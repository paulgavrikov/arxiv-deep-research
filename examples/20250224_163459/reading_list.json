      "relevancy": "This paper, published in 2021, focuses on improving adversarial robustness of CNNs using adversarially trained GANs, a relevant technique in the field.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing specifically on papers published within the last two years (2022-2024, since the current date is late 2024), as well as the paper's publication date (which is unknown).\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper introduces a novel adversarial defense method called \"Adversarially Trained GAN\" (ATGAN) to improve the adversarial robustness of image classifiers against *L*<sub>\u221e</sub> norm bounded adversarial examples. It focuses on improving the *generalization* of adversarial robustness, which is the ability of a model to remain robust even when faced with adversarial examples generated with different parameters than those used during training.\n\n**Key Ideas and Contributions:**\n\n*   **ATGAN Framework:** Combines adversarial training (AT) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It uses a conditional GAN (cGAN) or Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN) architecture. The generator network is designed to map adversarial examples back to the manifold of clean examples, thereby \"denoising\" the input before it is fed to the classifier.\n*   **Addressing Obfuscated Gradients:**  The paper argues that many GAN-based defenses suffer from \"obfuscated gradients,\" giving a false sense of security. ATGAN integrates adversarial training directly into the GAN training loop to mitigate this issue. The discriminator is trained to classify both real and generated images, as well as predict class labels, allowing AT to be applied to the GAN directly.\n*   **Improving Robustness Generalization:** ATGAN uses the image-to-image generator as a form of data augmentation, increasing the sample complexity needed for adversarial robustness generalization. A perceptual loss is adopted to increase the quality of the output of the generator. The perceptual loss uses a pre-trained CNN to extract high-level feature representations, then calculates the difference of the output of the generator and the clean examples based on these high-level feature representations.\n*   **Evaluation:**  The method is evaluated on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets against *L*<sub>\u221e</sub> norm bounded adversarial examples generated using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).  The paper uses \"robustness curves\" to comprehensively evaluate the global robustness of the models. Also uses Saliency maps to qualitatively evaluate the robustness of the features learned by different models. The paper also includes tests to demonstrate that ATGAN does not rely on obfuscated gradients.\n\n**Relevant Trends and Techniques:**\n\nBased on the content of the provided paper, we can identify the following trends in adversarial robustness research during the last two years. Note, however, that we must assume publication took place in or before 2022. The paper is more likely to reference older publications, but the work contained in the paper can still be seen as reflective of trends in the community:\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training (AT) as a Foundation:** The paper explicitly states that AT is \"by so far the only effective adversarial defense method which doesn\u2019t rely on the obfuscated gradients and can truly improve the adversarial robustness of the target model.\" This points to AT (Madry et al. [24]) being a core technique upon which more advanced defenses are built. Note that the paper focuses on *improving* AT, not replacing it.\n\n2.  **Generative Models (GANs) for Defense:** Using GANs to defend against adversarial attacks is a significant trend.  The idea is to use the GAN to \"clean up\" or \"repair\" adversarial examples before they are fed to the classifier. The paper identifies a key challenge with GAN-based defenses: obfuscated gradients.\n\n3.  **Importance of Robustness Generalization:** The paper emphasizes the importance of *generalizing* adversarial robustness.  It's not enough to be robust to the specific type of attack used during training; the model needs to be robust to a wider range of attacks. The paper mentions that the robustness generalization gap is further enlarged when the perturbations are larger than the value used during training [24].\n\n4.  **Data Augmentation for Adversarial Robustness:** The paper adopts the image-to-image generator as data augmentation to increase the sample complexity needed for adversarial robustness generalization in adversarial training.\n\n5.  **Addressing Obfuscated Gradients:** A major focus is on creating defenses that *actually* work, rather than defenses that appear to work but are easily circumvented by stronger attacks.  The work of Athalye et al. [40] is referenced, which exposed the issue of obfuscated gradients.\n\n6.  **Evaluation Methodology:** The paper highlights the inadequacy of using single perturbation thresholds to evaluate robustness.  It promotes the use of \"robustness curves\" [61] to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of adversarial robustness.\n\n7.  **The L\u221e Norm Threat Model:** The paper is specifically focused on defending against *L*<sub>\u221e</sub> norm bounded adversarial examples.  This is a common threat model in adversarial robustness research.\n\n8. **Semi-Supervised Learning for Robustness:** The paper mentions research [48-51] indicating that leveraging unlabeled data can significantly improve adversarial robustness.\n\n**Limitations and Potential Issues (based on the abstract and introduction):**\n\n*   **Computational Cost:** GANs are notoriously difficult to train and can be computationally expensive.  The paper doesn't explicitly address the computational cost of ATGAN.\n*   **Dataset Specificity:**  The effectiveness of ATGAN might be highly dependent on the dataset. The paper mentions that the impact of the choice of *\u03f5*<sub>t</sub> (perturbation magnitude) is dataset-specific.\n*   **White-box Setting:** The paper focuses on white-box attacks, where the attacker has full knowledge of the model.  The robustness of ATGAN in black-box settings (where the attacker has limited knowledge) is not explored.\n\n**Citations of potentially relevant recent papers**\n\nThe following papers are cited by the provided paper and may therefore provide additional insights into recent trends in adversarial robustness (note that I cannot verify their relevance without access to the full text):\n\n*   **Xu et al.

[62]** *\"How to compare adversarial robustness of classifiers from a global perspective.\"* (2020) - Further explains evaluating adversarial robustness from a global perspective.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe paper highlights the ongoing trend of using adversarial training as a core defense mechanism and explores the use of GANs to improve the *generalization* of adversarial robustness, while also addressing the issue of obfuscated gradients.  The emphasis on robustness generalization and the evaluation methodology (robustness curves) are also important trends. The study also explores the effect of the training and testing dataset on robustness."

      "relevancy": "This 2024 paper presents a deep ensemble model to achieve adversarial robustness in image classification, using generative models, which aligns with the research question.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**General Information about the Paper**\n\n*   **Title:** A Robust Adversarial Ensemble with Causal (Feature Interaction) Interpretations for Image Classification\n*   **Authors:** Chunheng Zhao, Pierluigi Pisu, Gurcan Comert, Negash Begashaw, Varghese Vaidyan, Nina Christine Hubig\n*   **Publication Date:** Preprint submitted to arXiv December 31, 2024 (This indicates the paper is recent and falls within the last 2 years)\n*   **Keywords:** pattern recognition, image classification, adversarial attacks, generative classifier\n\n**Summary of the paper:** The paper introduces a deep ensemble model combining discriminative features with generative models to enhance both accuracy and adversarial robustness. This method uses a bottom-level pre-trained discriminative network for feature extraction and a top-level generative classification network that models adversarial input distributions using a deep latent variable model with variational Bayes. Results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show improved robustness against white-box adversarial attacks without adversarial training. The paper also investigates correlations between model interpretability and adversarial robustness.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness):**\n\nThe paper contributes to the following trends in adversarial robustness:\n\n1.  **Hybrid Discriminative-Generative Models:** A key trend is the move beyond purely discriminative or generative models towards hybrid architectures.  The paper explicitly combines the strengths of both approaches. Discriminative models excel in classification accuracy with clean data, while generative models offer inherent robustness by modeling the underlying data distribution.\n\n    *   The paper highlights that discriminative classifiers are vulnerable because they model decision boundaries, making them susceptible to outliers. Generative classifiers, by modeling class distributions, are more resilient.\n    *   The authors propose a bottom-up architecture: a pre-trained discriminative network (VGG) extracts features, and a generative network classifies based on these features and the original image. This leverages the strengths of both.\n\n2.  **Emphasis on Model Interpretability:** There's a growing recognition that adversarial vulnerability is linked to a lack of model interpretability. Improving interpretability can lead to more robust models.\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes that adversarial training doesn't solve the \"intrinsic problem of adversarial vulnerability,\" which is a lack of interpretability.\n    *   The proposed model incorporates causal graphs in the generative classifier. The paper argues that by modeling causal relationships rather than just statistical correlations, the model becomes more interpretable and robust.\n    *   The paper explicitly evaluates model interpretability using counterfactual metrics (proximity/perturbation size, speed/attack iterations) and feature attribution analysis (ROAR - Remove and Retrain).  The findings suggest a strong correlation between interpretability and robustness.\n\n3.  **Moving Beyond Adversarial Training:** While adversarial training remains important, there is interest in developing techniques that enhance robustness without relying solely on it.\n\n    *   The paper explicitly aims to achieve robustness *without* adversarial training. It leverages the generative component and causal modeling to achieve this.\n    *   The authors point out that adversarial training is computationally expensive and doesn't address the fundamental problem of interpretability.\n    *   The authors emphasize that they train only on *clean* data to reduce training time and computational costs.\n\n4.  **Evaluation on Complex Datasets:** The paper addresses a limitation in previous research by evaluating on full CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, as well as preliminary experiments on Tiny-ImageNet.  This demonstrates the scalability and potential for real-world applications.\n\n    *   Previous work with generative classifiers often struggled to achieve satisfactory results on full image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10).\n    *   The paper explicitly aims to develop a generalized deep generative classifier architecture for more complex datasets.\n\n5.  **Focus on Strong Attack Evaluation:**  The paper evaluates against strong white-box attacks, including PGD (Projected Gradient Descent), which is considered a state-of-the-art attack.\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes evaluating robustness against PGD, which prioritizes attack success rates over perturbation size, making it a challenging benchmark.\n\n**Specific details supporting the trends:**\n\n*   **Architecture Details:** The model uses a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based generative classifier. The VAE's encoder network infers latent variables representing adversarial perturbations and other factors.  The decoder network reconstructs the input based on these latent variables and the class label.\n*   **Causal Modeling:**  The causal graph models the relationships between input images, discriminative features, output labels, and latent variables (adversarial perturbations and other factors). This allows the model to learn causal relations rather than merely statistical correlations.\n*   **Interpretability Metrics:**\n    *   *Counterfactual Proximity:*  The perturbation size needed for adversarial examples.  Larger perturbation sizes indicate better interpretability.\n    *   *Counterfactual Generating Speed:* The number of iterations required to reduce accuracy to a threshold (e.g., 0.4).  Slower attack speed indicates better interpretability.\n    *   *ROAR (Remove and Retrain):*  Measures the accuracy degradation after removing important features (identified by integrated gradients). Greater degradation indicates better interpretability.\n\n**Citations of Relevant Recent Work (within the last 2 years, extracted from the paper):**\n\n*   **Maur\u00b4\u0131cio et al.

The paper's emphasis on causal modeling and interpretability metrics are particularly noteworthy."

      "relevancy": "Published in 2024, this paper focuses on test-time adversarial purification to enhance robustness, which is directly relevant to the research question.",
      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided research paper and extracted the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information, focusing on trends, techniques, and relevant citations within the specified timeframe (2022-2024, although the paper may cite older work):\n\n**I. Core Idea of the Paper (and its Relevance to Trends)**\n\n*   **Test-Time Pixel-Level Adversarial Purification (TPAP):** The paper proposes a novel defense strategy called TPAP that uses a Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) robust overfitting network and adversarial purification processing *at testing time*. This is relevant because it shifts the focus from purely training-based defenses to methods that actively mitigate adversarial effects during inference.\n\n*   **FGSM Robust Overfitting (FGSM-RO):** TPAP leverages the \"robust overfitting\" characteristic of DNNs trained with FGSM. While FGSM adversarial training alone might lead to catastrophic overfitting, the paper uses this to its advantage *in conjunction with test-time purification*.  This suggests a trend of *re-evaluating and repurposing* potentially problematic training phenomena for defense.\n\n**II. Trends Highlighted & Techniques Discussed (with Citations of Recent Work):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Purification:** The paper frames TPAP within the broader context of adversarial purification, which is a trend that focuses on cleaning or modifying input data before feeding it into the classifier during testing.\n    *   This is positioned as an alternative to adversarial training (AT), which focuses on improving robustness through network training.\n    *   The paper cites various methods that use additional networks (VAE, GAN, DUNET) for image purification *\\[1, 8, 13, 16, 23, 32, 52, 54, 58, 59]*\n    *   It is mentioned that some of these methods reduce the accuracy of clean examples and/or are computationally intensive.\n\n*   **Spatial-Constrained Attacks and the Need for Generalization:** The paper notes that many defenses are tailored to specific attack methods (e.g., PGD) and exhibit weaknesses against other types of attacks like Faster Wasserstein Attack (FWA) *\\[48]* and Spatially Transformed Attacks (STA) *\\[49]*. This points to a crucial trend: **improving the robust generalization of defenses against diverse and *unseen* attacks.**\n\n*   **Improving FGSM-AT (and Avoiding Catastrophic Overfitting):** The paper alludes to a body of work focused on improving FGSM adversarial training to *prevent* catastrophic overfitting, as this can reduce robustness *\\[2, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 41, 46]*. TPAP takes a different approach by *embracing* FGSM robust overfitting as a feature.\n\n*   **Diffusion Models for Denoising:** The paper references the use of diffusion models for denoising adversarial examples as another adversarial purification technique *\\[28, 42]*. Gaussian noises are gradually added to adversarial images and then removed by a reverse reconstruction process.\n\n*   **Category-Calibrated Fair Adversarial Training:** Zeming Wei et al. *\\[45]* studied the preferences of different categories for adversarial perturbations and introduced a category-calibrated fair adversarial training framework that automatically tailors specific training configurations for each category.\n\n*   **Dynamics-Aware Robust Training (DyART):** Xu et al. *\\[51]* proposed Dynamics-Aware Robust Training (DyART), which encourages the decision boundary to engage in movement that prioritizes increasing smaller margins.\n\n*   **Diffusion Models for Data Augmentation:** Wang et al. *\\[44]* proposed to exploit better diffusion networks to generate much extra high-quality data for adversarial training, which can improve the robustness accuracy of DNNs.\n\n**III. Specific Techniques & Insights from the Paper (Potentially Reflecting Trends):**\n\n*   **Pre-Classification Prior Knowledge:** TPAP utilizes the pre-predicted labels from the FGSM-RO-DNN to guide the adversarial purification process.  This highlights the value of *leveraging information already present in the network's initial prediction* to refine the input.\n\n*   **Untargeted Purification:** The purification process in TPAP is untargeted, meaning it aims to remove adversarial noise *without* trying to force the image towards a specific incorrect class.  This is a potentially more generalizable approach.\n\n*   **Trade-offs in Hyperparameter Tuning:** The paper explicitly explores the impact of learning rate, batch size, and perturbation strength on FGSM robust overfitting. This indicates the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning when working with these types of adversarial training techniques.\n\n**IV. Limitations (Acknowledged by the Authors - Reflecting Open Problems):**\n\n*   **Vulnerability to Strong Perturbations:** TPAP struggles to defend against attacks with excessively large perturbations. This reflects a persistent challenge in adversarial robustness: maintaining effectiveness against strong, carefully crafted attacks.\n*   **Not performing well in defending against 8/255 FGSM adversarial examples.**\n\n**V.

However, it *does* offer valuable context by:\n\n1.  **Identifying the state-of-the-art (as of 2021):** This is important because you need to know what techniques were prominent *before* you can assess what's changed in the last two years.\n2.  **Highlighting open challenges:** The paper clearly states limitations and areas where further research is needed.  These areas likely became focuses of more recent work.\n3.  **Providing relevant references:** Although the core paper is not recent, its references point to important works that establish the foundation for later research.\n\n**Here's a detailed extraction based on the paper's content:**\n\n**I. Key Areas of Focus (as of 2021, relevant for establishing a baseline):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Robustness in Medical Image Analysis:** The paper investigates the vulnerability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used for lumbar disc shape reconstruction from MR images to adversarial attacks.  This highlights the growing concern about the reliability of DNNs in critical applications like medical diagnosis.\n*   **In-Distribution (IND) vs. Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Robustness:**  The study differentiates between these two types of adversarial attacks, a crucial distinction for understanding the scope of robustness.\n    *   **IND Attacks:**  Small, often imperceptible, perturbations to input images that cause the DNN to misclassify or generate incorrect outputs.\n    *   **OOD Attacks:**  Input samples that are significantly different from the training data (e.g., a CT scan fed into a model trained on MRIs). The goal of an OOD *adversarial* attack is to make the DNN produce outputs similar to those it would give for an in-distribution sample, effectively masking the OOD nature of the input.\n*   **Adversarial Training:** The paper explores adversarial training as a defense mechanism against IND attacks. This involves augmenting the training data with adversarial examples (noisy images) to improve the model's robustness.\n*   **Statistical Shape Models (SSMs) for Data Augmentation:**  The paper utilizes SSMs to generate virtual shapes and images, increasing the size and diversity of the training data. The paper explores how increasing the size of the training dataset helps improve robustness.\n*   **U-Net Architecture:** A U-Net style CNN is used for both image segmentation and shape regression, indicating its popularity and suitability for medical image analysis tasks.\n*   **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) Attack:**  The PGD algorithm is employed to generate both IND and OOD adversarial examples, showing its wide applicability in robustness evaluation.\n*   **Reconstruction-Based OOD Detection:**  The paper examines the use of reconstruction autoencoders for detecting OOD samples, a common approach that they found to be ineffective against OOD adversarial attacks.\n\n**II. Specific Findings & Limitations (as of 2021, suggesting directions for future research):**\n\n*   **Vulnerability to IND Attacks:**  CNNs trained with standard loss functions are highly susceptible to IND adversarial attacks.\n*   **Adversarial Training Improves IND Robustness:** Adversarial training can significantly enhance a model's resilience to IND attacks. Larger training datasets led to higher IND robustness.\n*   **OOD Detection is a Major Challenge:** Existing OOD detection methods (specifically, reconstruction-based approaches) are easily fooled by OOD adversarial attacks.\n*   **Computational Cost of OOD Adversarial Training:** The vastness of the OOD sample space makes OOD adversarial training impractical.\n*   **Blurry Boundary Between IND and OOD Attacks:** At high noise levels, the distinction between IND and OOD attacks becomes less clear.\n*   **Standard loss function (P10_std) cannot detect any difference in image patterns between the disk images (IND samples) and the noisy CT images (OOD samples).**\n\n**III. Algorithms and Methods:**\n\n*   **Algorithm 1: Adversarial Attack (IND or OOD):**  This is a PGD-based algorithm that can be used for both IND and OOD attacks by changing the objective function.\n*   **Loss Functions:** The paper details the loss functions used for training (shape regression loss, segmentation loss, reconstruction loss) and for crafting adversarial examples (IND and OOD objective functions).\n* **IND Adversarial Training:**\n    *   \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63_\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60 = 0.5\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc65) + 0.5 (0.5\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54)) + 0.5\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54)))\n    *   \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63_\ud835\udc5f = 0.5\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc65) + 0.5\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54))\n    *   \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63_\ud835\udc60 = 0.5\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc65) + 0.5\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54))\n\n**IV.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically focusing on papers from the last 2 years (assuming the current year is 2023 or 2024, making 2021-2022 the relevant timeframe, though the paper itself is from 2021):\n\n**1. General Trend: Adversarial Robustness in Meta-Learning**\n\n*   **Challenge:**  The primary trend identified is the growing interest in and challenge of improving adversarial robustness *specifically within meta-learning models*. Traditional adversarial training techniques are computationally expensive, and directly applying them to meta-learning often results in a significant drop in accuracy on clean (non-adversarial) images.\n*   **Problem Statement:** The paper frames the core issue as how to train meta-learning models on few-shot tasks to robustly defend against adversarial examples while still adapting quickly to new, unseen tasks.\n*   **Model Agnostic Meta-Learning:**  The paper highlights the need for *model-agnostic* approaches, meaning methods that can be applied to various meta-learning architectures.\n\n**2. Existing Approaches (within the last 2 years, as cited by the paper):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Querying (AQ) (Goldblum et al., 2020):**\n    *   Considered a \"state-of-the-art\" approach at the time of the paper.\n    *   Involves adversarial training *specifically during the query step* of meta-learning.\n    *   Drawbacks: Still computationally expensive and can lead to a noticeable decrease in accuracy on clean images.\n*    **(Wang et al., 2021):** A robustness-regularized metalearning framework, which can be treated as a generalized AQ model.\n\n**3. Proposed Solution: Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT)**\n\n*   **Core Idea:**  LCAT updates meta-learning model parameters by \"crossing\" between the natural (clean) and adversarial sample distributions over a \"long-term\" training period. The model parameter \u03b8 crosses along the natural and adversarial sample distribution direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot classification accuracy.\n*   **Model-Agnostic:**  LCAT is designed to be model-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to different meta-learning architectures.\n*   **Efficiency:** Claims to require only half the adversarial training epochs compared to AQ, resulting in lower computational cost.\n*   **Benefits:** Aims to improve both adversarial robustness *and* maintain/improve accuracy on clean images, addressing the accuracy drop issue of other methods.\n*   **Implementation Details:**\n    *   **Alternating Training:**  The method involves alternating between optimizing the model on clean batches of tasks and adversarial batches of tasks.\n    *   **Long-Term Training:** This \"long-term\" training is key. The paper argues that short-term adversarial training doesn't allow the model to adequately explore the adversarial sample space.\n    *   **Denoising Module:** The paper mentions adding a denoising module to the meta-learning model to avoid poor performance of the model in few-shot classification, but it is not clear from the paper when the denoising module is added, either at the initial training stage or at the cross adversarial training stage.\n*   **Experimental Results:** The paper claims superior performance (compared to AQ and other baselines) on both clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy on the MiniImageNet dataset. For example, a 9.7% improvement in clean accuracy and a 2.88% improvement in adversarial accuracy (5-way 5-shot) compared to MetaOptNet.\n\n**4. Related Work (cited in the paper, relevant for context):**\n\n*   **General Adversarial Training:** References traditional adversarial training methods (Madry et al., 2017a; Su et al., 2016) as a foundation.\n*   **Defensive Distillation (Papernot et al., 2016):**\n*   **Feature Denoising (Xie et al., 2019):**\n*   **TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019):**  A method that theoretically balances the trade-off between accuracy and robustness; used in the paper as AQ+TRADES\n*   **Adversarial Detection (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Xu et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2017; Grosse et al., 2017):**\n\n**5. Key Takeaways and Trends:**\n\n*   **Meta-learning Robustness is Important:**  Adversarial robustness in the context of meta-learning is a recognized and actively researched area.\n*   **Trade-offs:**  A key challenge is balancing robustness against adversarial examples with maintaining good performance on clean, non-adversarial data and fast adaptation to new tasks (the core strength of meta-learning).\n*   **Computational Efficiency:**  There's a focus on developing robust meta-learning methods that are *computationally efficient*, as directly applying standard adversarial training can be very expensive.\n*   **Cross-Training/Alternating Training:** The LCAT method suggests that alternating between training on clean and adversarial data distributions can be effective.\n*    **Denoising Method:** In addition, it is also important to add denoise module to the meta-learning model to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot classification accuracy.\n\n**In summary, the paper highlights a trend toward addressing adversarial robustness specifically in meta-learning. LCAT offers a computationally efficient approach, but the broader trend involves exploring different training strategies (like alternating clean/adversarial training) and architectures to achieve a better balance between robustness, accuracy, and adaptation speed in few-shot learning scenarios.**"

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of information from the provided paper, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years.\n\n**Paper Focus:** The paper introduces \"PatchZero,\" a defense mechanism against adversarial patch attacks. It detects and removes adversarial patches by \"zeroing out\" the affected region in an image.  The paper focuses on white-box attacks, where the attacker has complete knowledge of the defense.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Adversarial Robustness Trends):**\n\nThe paper *directly* contributes to the research question by proposing a novel defense strategy and evaluating it against current adversarial attacks. More specifically:\n\n*   **Type of Attack Addressed:** Adversarial *patch* attacks. This is a key sub-area within adversarial robustness, focusing on localized, physically realizable attacks.\n*   **Defense Type:** Detection and removal of adversarial perturbations *without* retraining the downstream classifier.  This is an important trend, as retraining can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to new attacks.\n\n**Key Trends and Insights (from the last 2 years, based on citations and content):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the trends the paper touches on, gleaned from the citations and the paper's content.  Note that the paper was published in WACV 2023, so \"last 2 years\" would be roughly 2021-2022, but I will expand on this.\n\n1.  **Focus on Patch Attacks:**  The paper highlights the increasing importance of defending against adversarial patch attacks due to their physical realizability. The introduction mentions several recent patch attacks:\n    *   DPatch [30] (Liu et al., 2018)\n    *   Robust DPatch [26] (Lee and Kolter, 2019)\n    *   Masked AutoPGD [9] (Croce and Hein, 2020)\n\n    This indicates a trend toward more realistic and practical adversarial threats.  The literature review discusses other patch attacks, like LaVAN [24] (Karmon et al., 2018) and extensions of Carlini-Wagner (CW) [5] and PGD [35] attacks, masked to restrict the attack region.\n\n2.  **Defense Strategies for Image Classification:**\n    The paper discusses several existing defense methods, highlighting their limitations:\n\n    *   **Digital Watermark (DW) [19] and Local Gradient Smoothing (LGS) [36]**:  Mentioned as early patch defenses, but noted as *ineffective* by Chiang et al. [8] (2020). This shows a trend of defenses being proposed and then subsequently broken or found to be limited.\n    *   **Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) [8]**:  An early certified defense.\n    *   **PatchGuard [45]** (Xiang et al., 2021):  Requires modifying the classifier and needs prior knowledge of patch size.\n    *   **PatchCleanser [46]** (Xiang et al., 2021): Uses ensemble and masking, also needing prior knowledge of patch size.\n    *  **(De)Randomized Smoothing [27]:** Another certified defense against patch attacks.\n\n    **Key Insight:**  The trend shows a move towards certified defenses (offering provable robustness guarantees), but often at the cost of classifier modification or requiring specific knowledge about the attack. PatchZero aims to address these limitations by *not* requiring retraining or prior knowledge.\n\n3.  **Adaptive Attacks:** The paper emphasizes the importance of defending against adaptive attacks, where the attacker is aware of the defense mechanism and tries to circumvent it. This reflects a growing awareness that defenses must be robust to intelligent adversaries.\n\n4.  **BPDA (Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation):** The use of BPDA [3] (Athalye et al., 2018) to approximate gradients through non-differentiable layers is a technique used to create stronger adaptive attacks. The paper leverages this to train a more robust patch detector.\n\n5.  **Two-Stage Training:** The paper introduces a two-stage adversarial training scheme, first with Downstream-Only (DO) attacks and then with BPDA adaptive attacks. This highlights a trend in *training strategies* to improve robustness against adaptive adversaries.\n\n6.  **Evaluation Metrics and Datasets:**\n\n    *   The paper uses standard datasets like ImageNet [10], RESISC-45 [6], and PASCAL VOC [12] for evaluation. This is a trend toward using established benchmarks for comparing defense methods.\n    *   Metrics include top-1 accuracy (for image classification) and Average Precision (AP) for object detection, reflecting standard practices in the field.\n\n**Specific Contributions of PatchZero (and their relevance to trends):**\n\n*   **Generality:**  Designed to be applicable to image classification, object detection, and video classification *without* task-specific modifications. This is valuable because many defenses are tailored to a single task.\n*   **No Retraining Required:** Can be plugged into existing classifiers without retraining, saving significant computational resources.\n*   **Robustness to Adaptive Attacks:**  Uses a two-stage training scheme and BPDA to defend against strong white-box adaptive attacks.\n*   **No Prior Knowledge Required:** Does not require knowledge of the patch size or shape.\n*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Claims to achieve state-of-the-art defense performance compared to previous work.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions (also indicative of trends):**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that missed patch detection can lead to defense failure.\n*   Occlusion by the patch can still cause issues.\n\nThis suggests that future research directions include:\n\n*   Improving patch detection accuracy, especially for patches with textures similar to the background.\n*   Developing methods to handle occlusion caused by adversarial patches.\n\n**Cited Papers within the Last 2 Years (roughly 2021-2022, keeping in mind publication lag):**\n\n*   \\[28] Liang et al., 2021.

The trend includes the development of more sophisticated attacks (adaptive attacks) and defenses that offer provable robustness. PatchZero attempts to address the limitations of existing defenses by providing a general, retraining-free, and adaptive-attack-resistant approach, demonstrating the value of detection-and-removal strategies."

      "relevancy": "This paper was published within the last two years and explores attacking a VAE to improve image classification, which is related to adversarial robustness and a slightly different trend.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper's relevance to the research question, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, and specifically extracting information from the last 2 years (2022-2024).\n\n**Paper Overview:**\n\nThe paper \"Learning from Attacks: Attacking Variational Autoencoder for Improving Image Classification\" (AVIC) explores a novel approach to adversarial robustness. Instead of solely defending against adversarial attacks, it leverages the information contained within adversarial examples to *improve* image classification accuracy.  The core idea is to use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a generator network to create adversarial examples. These adversarial examples, generated by attacking the VAE, are then used to train a classifier. The authors argue that adversarial examples crafted to disrupt the VAE's reconstruction contain key features beneficial for classification.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness for Image Classification - Last 2 Years):**\n\nWhile the paper doesn't explicitly survey \"latest trends,\" it *contributes* to a trend of *rethinking* adversarial attacks and utilizing them constructively, rather than just defensively.  Here's how it fits within the scope:\n\n*   **Shifting Perspective:** The paper aligns with a trend of moving *beyond* traditional adversarial training (which focuses on making models robust *against* attacks) towards methods that *benefit* from adversarial perturbations. This reflects a deeper understanding that adversarial examples aren't merely \"bugs\" but contain valuable information.\n*   **Generative Models for Robustness:** The use of a VAE (a generative model) as part of the defense/training mechanism is relevant.  There's been growing interest in using generative models, not just for creating attacks, but also for improving robustness. The AVIC framework uses the VAE's self-expression capability to extract abstract features from adversarial examples, highlighting a trend of leveraging unsupervised learning for enhanced robustness.\n*   **Joint Training/Optimization:** The \"globally end-to-end training\" aspect of AVIC aligns with a trend of joint optimization of defense mechanisms and classifiers.  Instead of training a defense separately and then applying it, AVIC jointly trains the generator (attacker) and the classifier, allowing them to adapt to each other.  This contributes to more effective robustness.\n*   **Attacks on Self-Expressive Models:** The paper references research on adversarial attacks on self-expressive models which focuses on changing the input data distribution or the latent representation distribution to generate wrong samples\n\n**Specific Details Extracted from the Paper:**\n\n1.  **Core Idea (AVIC Framework):**\n    *   Train a VAE to learn the underlying distribution of image data.\n    *   Train a Generator network to create adversarial examples that *maximize* the reconstruction loss of the VAE (i.e., effectively attack the VAE).\n    *   Train a Classifier using these adversarial examples.\n    *   Jointly retrain the Generator and Classifier in an end-to-end fashion.\n\n2.  **Key Claims/Contributions:**\n    *   Adversarial examples generated by attacking a VAE contain features that are *more useful* for classification than standard (classifier-targeted) adversarial examples or clean examples.\n    *   The AVIC framework leverages both unsupervised (VAE) and supervised (classifier) learning.\n    *   The classification network within AVIC is flexible (can use various architectures like ResNet, VGG).\n    *   AVIC achieves better performance on standard datasets compared to training with clean examples or traditional adversarial training.\n\n3.  **Related Work (Specific Mentions):** The paper references several papers which highlights existing trends.\n    *   **Adversarial Training:**  Acknowledges the traditional approach of adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., Madry et al.).\n    *   **Input Transformations:** Notes the use of input transformations as a defense (Guo et al.).\n    *    **Feature Denoising:** Mentions feature denoising techniques for robustness (Xie et al.).\n    *   **Adversarial Examples as Features:** Cites works that analyze adversarial examples not as bugs, but as features carrying useful information (Ilyas et al.).\n    *   **Joint Classification and Reconstruction Networks:** Highlights research on using reconstruction networks (self-expressive models) to aid image classification.\n\n4.  **Experiments and Results:**\n    *   Datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100\n    *   Comparison: Compared AVIC to training with clean examples, adversarial examples generated by attacking the classification network, and adversarial examples generated by attacking the VAE.\n    *   Results: AVIC achieved higher classification accuracy than the other methods.\n    *   Ablation Studies:  Examined the impact of adversarial attacker strength (perturbation size), different architectures of classifier, and different cost functions for global training.\n\n**Limitations Based on the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Not a Survey:** The paper is a research paper presenting a specific method, not a survey or review of the field. While it references some related work, it doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of all recent trends in adversarial robustness.\n*   **Indirect Relevance:** While AVIC contributes to certain trends, it doesn't explicitly *discuss* the trends in detail. The trends are inferred from the method and its positioning relative to other work.\n*   **Date of Publication:** It's important to verify the publication/release date of the paper itself to ensure it falls within the \"last 2 years\" window.\n\n**In summary:** This paper is relevant because it contributes to a trend of constructively using adversarial examples for image classification, leveraging generative models, and employing joint training strategies. However, it's not a comprehensive survey of the latest trends and should be supplemented with other sources for a broader perspective."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**High-Level Summary:**\n\nThe paper itself does *not* directly address the research question. It focuses on adversarial attacks against *image segmentation models*, not image classification models.  It does, however, *leverage concepts from adversarial robustness in image classification* (specifically, certified radius) to develop a novel attack framework for image segmentation.  Therefore, the paper provides insights into *how concepts from the image classification domain are being adapted and applied in the image segmentation domain*.\n\n**Key Information (with an emphasis on connecting to the research question's themes):**\n\n1.  **Focus on Segmentation, Not Classification:**  The paper explicitly distinguishes between image classification and image segmentation:\n    *   \"Image classification models have a single prediction for an entire image, while image segmentation models have a prediction for each pixel.\"\n    *   The paper argues that existing attack methods for image segmentation \"majorly follow the idea of attacking image classification models\" (based on FGSM and PGD), but that these are suboptimal due to the per-pixel prediction in segmentation providing more information for attackers.\n\n2.  **Leveraging Certified Radius (a Classification Concept) for Attacks:**\n    *   **Inspiration from Certified Robustness:**  \"Our attack framework is inspired by certified radius, which was originally used by defenders to defend against adversarial perturbations to classification models.\"\n    *   **Adaptation to Segmentation:** The authors adapt randomized smoothing, \"the state-of-the-art certification method for classification models\", to derive a \"pixel's certified radius\" in image segmentation.\n    *   **Certified Radius Definition:**  \"A larger certified radius of a pixel means the pixel is theoretically more robust to adversarial perturbations. This observation inspires us to focus more on disrupting pixels with relatively smaller certified radii.\"\n    *   **Attacker Perspective:** \"We are the first, from the attacker perspective, to leverage the properties of certified radius and propose a certified radius guided attack framework against image segmentation models.\"\n\n3.  **Randomized Smoothing:** The paper uses randomized smoothing to estimate the certified radius. This is a significant point because randomized smoothing is a prominent technique in certified robustness for *image classification*.\n    *   \"We propose to adopt randomized smoothing [33], [46], which is the state-of-the-art certification method for smoothed image classification models, and the only method that is scalable to large models. We generalize randomize smoothing to derive pixel-wise certified radius for image segmentation models\"\n    * The process involves building a smoothed soft classifier and using a Gaussian distribution.\n\n4.  **White-Box and Black-Box Attack Frameworks:** The paper designs both white-box and black-box attack methods:\n    *   **White-Box:** They design a \"pixel-wise certified radius guided loss\" function that weights pixels based on their certified radius. This loss is then plugged into existing white-box attacks (like PGD).\n    *   **Black-Box:** They propose a black-box attack via a bandit optimization framework.  A key element is a \"novel gradient estimator, based on bandit feedback, which is query-efficient and provably unbiased and stable.\"  They design \"projected bandit gradient descent (PBGD)\" and a \"certified radius-guided PBGD (CR-PBGD)\" attack.\n    *   **Theoretical Guarantees:** The authors prove that their PBGD and CR-PBGD attacks \"can achieve asymptotically optimal attack performance with an optimal rate.\"\n\n5.  **Experimental Validation:**\n    *   The authors evaluate their attacks on modern image segmentation models (PSPNet, PSANet, HRNet) and datasets (Pascal VOC, Cityscapes, ADE20K).\n    *   Results show that the certified radius-guided attacks outperform baseline methods.\n\n6.  **Defenses:**\n    * The paper evaluates the state-of-the-art empirical defense FastADT [66] and provable defense SEGCERTIFY [67] against their attacks.\n    * They defend against their white-box CRPGD attack.\n    * Finding: \"these defenses can mitigate our attack to some extent, but are still not effective enough.\"\n\n7.  **Related Works:**  The paper cites several papers related to attacks and defenses for image segmentation, and to certified radius for image classification. The related works section can be used to explore the trends in adversarial robustness, although it is not limited to the last two years.\n\n    *Attacks:* [3], [4], [6], [7]\n    *Defenses:* [67], [83]-[87]\n    *Certified Radius:* [14]-[30], [31]-[45]\n\n**Why This Is Relevant (Even Though Not Directly Answering the Question):**\n\n*   **Cross-Domain Adaptation:**  The paper demonstrates a trend of taking successful concepts from adversarial robustness research in image classification (certified radius, randomized smoothing) and adapting them to other domains (image segmentation). This is a valuable insight.\n*   **Focus on Certified Robustness:** The paper highlights the continued importance of \"certified robustness\" as a research area, even if this paper is using it for attack purposes.\n*   **Black-Box Attacks:** The black-box attack framework using bandit optimization reflects a growing interest in developing attacks that work in more realistic scenarios where attackers have limited information.\n\n**In summary, while the paper doesn't *directly* tell us about the latest trends in adversarial robustness for *image classification*, it *indirectly* shows how ideas from that field (certified radius, randomized smoothing) are being actively explored and extended in the context of image segmentation, and it uses ideas from bandit optimization to improve black-box attacks.**"

      "relevancy": "This paper, published in the last two years, focuses on defending against data poisoning attacks using influence functions which is relevant to adversarial robustness.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's extract the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question:  **What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information, focusing on trends and papers published within the last two years (approximately since today is late October, 2024, we are considering papers from late October 2022 onwards):\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper (and its Relevance):**\n\n*   The paper presents a defense mechanism against *data poisoning attacks* called **Healthy Influential-Noise based Training (HINT)**.  Data poisoning attacks are a type of *adversarial attack* where malicious data is injected into the training set to compromise the model's performance.  Therefore, the paper *directly addresses* the broad topic of adversarial robustness.\n\n**II. Trends in Defenses Against Poisoning Attacks (and, by extension, Adversarial Attacks):**\n\nThe paper explicitly discusses several trends in defense strategies against data poisoning attacks, which contribute to adversarial robustness. It categorizes them as:\n\n*   **Filtering Defenses:** These methods aim to *detect and remove* malicious examples from the training data before training. The paper mentions techniques like:\n\n    *   Clustering methods on activation layers to detect poisons [12].\n    *   Using data provenance to identify poisoned data [13].\n    *   Examining the distribution shift between malicious and clean inputs [14].\n    *   EPIC: An effective defense that performs filtering during the training phase [10].  This is further detailed later in the paper and is used as a baseline.\n\n    *Limitations:* These defenses often assume a small fraction of poisoned data and can be computationally expensive. They may also be vulnerable if the malicious perturbations are subtle.\n\n*   **Robust Training Methods:** These methods use smoothing and augmentation techniques to make the model more resilient to noisy data. The paper discusses:\n\n    *   **Randomized Smoothing:** A unified framework to deal with poisoning attacks via randomized smoothing [24].\n    *   **Data Augmentation:**  Using strong data augmentation like MixUp [25].\n    *   **MixUp with Differential Privacy:** Combining MixUp with random smoothing noise from differentially private training [26].\n    *   **Adversarial Training:** Leveraging adversarial training (initially proposed for evasion attacks) to defend against poisoning attacks [7, 9].  This involves simulating attacks during the training phase by injecting targeted poisoning attacks.\n    *   **Optimizing Friendly Noise:** Optimizing two components, friendly noise, and random noise, to perturb training examples [8]. FRIENDS is also described as a baseline method in the experiment section of the paper.\n    *   **Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD):**  A strategy to train a robust model against poisoning attacks [27, 28].\n\n    *HINT's Place:*  HINT falls under the \"robust training\" category.  It's similar to FRIENDS and ATDA as all three perturb training examples to defend against poisoning attacks. The key difference lies in *how* the perturbation is done: HINT uses influence functions to identify influential pixels and craft \"healthy noise\" to strengthen helpful regions and weaken harmful ones. Also, HINT perturbs only a *subset* of the training data.\n\n**III. Specific Defense Mechanisms Mentioned (Within the Last 2 Years, as Baselines):**\n\nThe paper compares HINT against the following defense mechanisms, which were published or updated (in the case of arxiv preprints) within the last two years:\n\n*   **FRIENDS (Friendly Noise)** [8] (NeurIPS 2022):  This method optimizes perturbations to training examples (\"friendly noise\") to increase robustness without changing model predictions significantly. It also adds random noise.\n*   **ATDA (Adversarial Training Against Delusive Adversaries)** [9] (NeurIPS 2021): This method uses adversarial training to defend against untargeted poisoning attacks.\n*   **EPIC** [10] (ICML 2022):  This filtering defense identifies and removes malicious training points based on their isolation in gradient space.\n\n**IV. Data Poisoning Attack Trends (Important Context):**\n\nThe paper mentions the following types of data poisoning attacks, which the defense mechanisms are designed to counter:\n\n*   **Untargeted Attacks (Availability Attacks):** Aim to degrade the overall utility of the machine learning model. Examples include:\n    *   Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) [2]\n    *   Delusive Adversarial Perturbation (DAP) [9]\n    *   Delusive Universal Random Perturbation (DURP) [9]\n    *   Deep Confuse (DC) [1]\n*   **Targeted Attacks (Integrity Attacks):** Aim to undermine the integrity of specific test examples. Examples include:\n    *   MetaPoison (MP) [5] (NeurIPS 2020)\n    *   Gradient Matching (GM) [4] (ICLR 2021)\n    *   Bullseye Polytope (BP) [3] (EuroS&P 2021)\n    *   Feature Collision (FC) [6]\n\n**V. Key Ideas and Novelty of HINT:**\n\n*   **Influence Functions:** HINT leverages influence functions to estimate the impact of training points and, more importantly, *individual pixels* on the model's loss. This allows for targeted noise crafting.\n*   **Healthy Influential Noise:**  The method generates noise that strengthens helpful regions in images and weakens harmful regions, making the model more resilient.\n*   **Subset Selection:** HINT selects a subset of the most influential training examples to perturb, reducing computational cost and potentially improving generalization.\n\n**VI. Experimental Results (Summary):**\n\n*   HINT outperforms baseline defenses (FRIENDS, ATDA, EPIC) against both untargeted and targeted attacks.\n*   HINT is particularly effective when the poison ratio is high.\n*   HINT maintains good generalization ability (minimal performance degradation on clean data).\n\n**VII. Future Directions:**\n\n*   The paper mentions extending the approach to defend against backdoor attacks.\n\n**In Summary of Trends:**\n\nBased on this paper and its cited works from the last two years:\n\n1.  **Focus on Robust Training:** Perturbing the training data, using methods like noise addition, adversarial training, and data augmentation, is a dominant trend. HINT contributes to this trend by using \"healthy influential noise\" based on influence functions.\n\n2.  **Attention to Targeted Attacks:** Defenses are increasingly addressing targeted attacks, which are more difficult to counter than untargeted attacks.\n\n3.  **Influence Functions for Explainability and Robustness:** Influence functions are being used not only to explain model behavior but also to improve robustness.\n\n4.  **Balancing Robustness and Generalization:** A key challenge is to develop defenses that are effective against adversarial attacks without sacrificing performance on clean data.\n\n5.  **Data Filtering Remains Relevant:** Data filtering, and outlier detection are still relevant as pre-processing or in-processing steps. However, the paper highlights the limitations of these approaches.\n\n6.  **Practical Attack Scenarios:**  Research is moving towards more realistic attack scenarios, such as those involving combinations of different attack types.\n\nThis detailed extraction should provide a good understanding of the current trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, as represented in this paper. Note that the provided paper only focuses on defenses against data poisoning attacks and does not include other types of adversarial robustness."

      "relevancy": "This paper, published in the last two years, uses latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without leveraging knowledge of what they are which is relevant to adversarial robustness.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**I.  Core Focus of the Paper and Relevance to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   The paper explores **latent adversarial training (LAT)** as a method to improve adversarial robustness in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks. LAT involves applying adversarial perturbations to the model's latent representations (hidden layers) instead of directly to the input.\n*   The paper is relevant because it presents a novel approach to enhance robustness against unforeseen or novel adversarial attacks, trojans (backdoors), and distribution shifts that may not be adequately addressed by traditional adversarial training (AT).\n\n**II. Key Concepts and Techniques:**\n\n*   **Latent Adversarial Training (LAT):** The core technique investigated.  LAT aims to make models more robust by training them with adversarial perturbations applied to the latent space (internal representations) of the network. This is contrasted with traditional adversarial training (AT), which perturbs the input space directly.\n*   **Lp-norm Attacks and Limitations:** The paper acknowledges the common use of Lp-norm attacks in AT but notes that real-world vulnerabilities often differ from these types of attacks. The paper explores defenses against failure modes beyond Lp-norm attacks. The authors find instances where Lp-norm AT in vision models makes them *more* susceptible to novel attacks.\n*   **Threat Model:** The paper does *not* focus on defending against attackers with direct access to the latent space. Instead, the goal is to improve robustness to distribution shifts and unforeseen failure modes that can emerge between the development and deployment phases.\n*   **Latent Space Distance Metric:** The paper explores both standard Lp-norm constraints and a *normalized* distance metric for constraining latent perturbations. The normalized metric aims to account for variations in activation distributions across different neurons in the latent space. However, the paper reports \"no clear differences\" in results between the two methods.\n*   **Untargeted vs. Targeted Attacks:** The paper uses \"untargeted\" attacks, where the adversary maximizes the model's loss.  Targeted attacks (eliciting a specific output) are suggested for future work.\n*   **Pareto Frontier Analysis:** The paper analyzes the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness by generating Pareto frontiers. This involves running multiple experiments with varying perturbation bounds and evaluating at multiple checkpoints.\n\n**III. Experiments and Results for Image Classification:**\n\n*   **Model and Dataset:** ResNet-50 is used for image classification on a poisoned version of ImageNet. The poisoning involves implanting 8 trojans, some triggered by pixel patches and others by \"natural features.\"\n*   **Baseline Methods:** The paper compares LAT to standard AT and training with random latent perturbations (RLP).\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** The models are evaluated on:\n    *   Clean ImageNet test set accuracy.\n    *   Robustness to held-out adversarial attacks from Kaufmann et al. (2019), *excluding* Lp-norm attacks.\n    *   Robustness to the implanted trojan triggers.\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   LAT *Pareto-dominates* AT and RLP, meaning it offers a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness.\n    *   LAT resulted in significantly greater improvements to the area under the Pareto curve for attack robustness and trojan removal compared to AT.\n    *   The paper finds an example of how Lp-norm AT can be *harmful* to robustness against novel attacks.  AT using Lp-norm attacks *increased* the model's susceptibility to other attacks.\n\n**IV. Related Work (Relevant Citations from the Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe following citations from the paper are potentially relevant to understanding the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification. I'm assuming that \"last 2 years\" means 2022 or later, based on the current date.\n\n*   **Zhao et al., 2022:** \"Adversarial training methods for deep learning: A systematic review.\" This would likely provide an overview of adversarial training techniques.\n*   **Carlini et al., 2022:** \"Quantifying memorization across neural language models.\" While focused on language models, it may offer insights into memorization of adversarial examples.\n*   **Ziegler et al., 2022:** \"Adversarial training for high-stakes reliability.\"\n*   **Bai et al., 2022:** \"Training a helpful and harmless assistant with reinforcement learning from human feedback.\"\n*   **Cossu et al., 2022:** \"Continual pre-training mitigates forgetting in language and vision.\"\n*   **Dai et al., 2022:** \"Formulating robustness against unforeseen attacks.\"\n\n**V. Insights into Trends and Future Directions:**\n\n*   **Beyond Lp-Norm Robustness:** The paper highlights a shift towards addressing more realistic and unforeseen adversarial threats beyond standard Lp-norm attacks.\n*   **Latent Space Exploitation:** The focus on LAT suggests a trend towards exploring the latent space of neural networks to improve robustness, potentially because it allows for more efficient or effective defenses.\n*   **Importance of Evaluation on Novel Attacks:** The paper underscores the need to evaluate robustness against held-out and diverse attack methods to avoid overfitting to specific attack types used during training.\n*   **Pareto Frontier as an Evaluation Tool:** The paper uses pareto frontier to allow for a range of hyperparameters to be evaluated and compared with each other.\n*   **Limitations and Future Directions:** The paper acknowledges that LAT is sensitive to hyperparameter tuning and the layer chosen for perturbation. Future research should explore ways to parameterize, regularize, and restrict latent space attacks for more reliable robustness.\n\nIn summary, the paper suggests a trend in adversarial robustness research toward moving beyond standard Lp-norm attacks, exploring latent space defenses, and emphasizing evaluation on diverse, held-out attack sets.  It also highlights that adversarial training techniques can sometimes have unintended consequences, such as increasing vulnerability to other types of attacks."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** FI-ODE: Certifiably Robust Forward Invariance in Neural ODEs\n\n**Key Idea:**  The paper proposes a framework (FI-ODE) for training Neural ODEs (NODEs) that are *certifiably* robust to adversarial perturbations, specifically for image classification (among other applications like control).  The core concept is to ensure *robust forward invariance* \u2013 that the NODE's trajectory stays within a \"safe\" region even under input perturbations.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness Trends (Focus: Image Classification):**\n\n*   **Certification of Robustness:** The paper addresses a significant trend: *moving beyond empirical robustness to provable (certified) robustness*. The goal is to provide guarantees that the classifier will be correct *within a defined threat model* (e.g., bounded L2 norm perturbations), not just to perform well against a specific set of attacks.\n\n*   **Neural ODEs in Robustness Research:** It highlights the growing interest in using Neural ODEs as a model architecture for robust classification. The abstract mentions showing \"superior \u21132 certified robustness versus other certifiably robust ODE-based models.\".\n*   **Lyapunov Functions and Forward Invariance:** FI-ODE approaches robustness via techniques borrowed from control theory. The trend is in applying ideas from control theory (like Lyapunov functions and forward invariance) to guarantee robustness of neural networks.\n*   **Lipschitz Constant Restriction:** A crucial component of the approach is *restricting the Lipschitz constant* of the NODE's dynamics.  This is a common theme in certified robustness \u2013 controlling the sensitivity of the network to small input changes.  The paper mentions using orthogonal layers to achieve a Lipschitz constant of 1.\n\n*   **Verifiers and Certification Procedures:** The work uses a combination of *sampling techniques* and *verification procedures* to certify robustness.  Specifically, it uses the *CROWN* linear relaxation-based verifier to bound the output of the computation graph.\n\n**Details from the Paper Directly Addressing Image Classification and Robustness:**\n\n*   **Problem Framing (Section 2):**  The paper specifically discusses image classification within the NODE context:  \"Other settings include image classification, where x are the images, and we evolve the system over t \u2208 [0, T ] to get the final prediction \u03b7(T ).\" It also draws an analogy between NODEs and ResNets, framing NODEs as ResNets with a continuum of hidden layers.\n*   **Robust Forward Invariance (Section 2):**  The paper defines robust forward invariance in the context of classification: \"In classification, we would want the system to classify correctly despite noisy inputs.\"\n*   **Lyapunov Function for Classification (Section 3.1):**  It defines a specific Lyapunov function tailored for multi-class classification.  This is key to framing the classification task in terms of forward invariance:\n\n    *   `Vy(\u03b7) = 1 \u2212 (\u03b7y \u2212 maxi\u0338=y \u03b7i)`\n\n    *   Where 'y' is the correct class label.\n*   **Theorem 3 and Robustness Condition (Section 3.2):** Theorem 3 gives the mathematical condition for robust forward invariance. Note that section 3.2 mentions the Lipschitz continuity of the Lyapunov function V and dynamics f\u03b8 as necessary to achieve robustness.\n*   **Restricting the Lipschitz constant (Section 3.3):** Crucially, Section 3.3 states, \"For image classification, we can estimate L[x]f easily by the product of matrix norms of the weight matrices in the neural network (Tsuzuku et al., 2018).\" This directly relates to controlling the network's sensitivity to input changes.\n*   **Certification Procedures (Section 3.4):** The core certification strategy involves:\n\n    1.  Sampling points on the decision boundary (the forward invariant set boundary).\n    2.  Verifying the Lyapunov condition holds in a neighborhood around those points using interval bound propagation (CROWN verifier).\n\n*   **Sampling Techniques Theorem 6 (Section 3.4):** This theorem gives details of the sampling on the boundary of a Forward Invariance set.\n*   **Experiments (Section 4.2):** The paper presents results on certified robustness for image classification (Table 2). The ablation studies are important, demonstrating that Lyapunov training, Lipschitz restriction, and adaptive sampling all contribute to the final certified accuracy. The approach outperforms previous ODE-based methods in terms of certified robustness on MNIST and CIFAR-10. They achieve a certified accuracy of 95.75% on MNIST with epsilon = 0.1, and 42.27% on CIFAR-10 with epsilon = 0.141.\n\n*   **Orthogonal Layers:** It explicitly mentions using orthogonal layers in the neural network in the CIFAR-10 experiment, tying this architectural choice to achieving a specific Lipschitz constant of 1.\n\n**Related Works (Section 5 - Very Important):**\n\n*   **Verification and Certified robustness of NODEs:** This part directly contrasts the paper's approach with previous NODE analyses, which primarily addressed reachability analysis or were limited to low-dimensional or linear NODEs.\n*   **Formal verification of neural networks:** This sections discussed relevant work in formal verification. It specifies the use of the CROWN verifier, and that the work is agnostic to verification algorithm.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work (Section 6):**\n\n*   The authors acknowledge the need to extend their method to higher-dimensional NODEs and more general Lyapunov functions.\n\n**Key References (within the last 2 years, based on the paper's publication date):**\n\n*   **Jimenez Rodriguez et al., 2022a:**  LyaNet: A Lyapunov framework for training neural ODEs (ICML 2022).

This contrasts with *empirical defenses*, which are often susceptible to new, unseen attacks. Certified robustness is a strong trend, offering provable guarantees.\n\n*   **Masking Strategies:** A central trend discussed is using masking strategies to neutralize adversarial patches. The core idea is to cover or remove potentially adversarial regions of the image.\n\n    *   **PatchCleanser (State-of-the-Art):** The paper builds upon and improves PatchCleanser, which is identified as the state-of-the-art certified defense against patch attacks as of 2022.  PatchCleanser uses a *double-masking* strategy. It creates a set of masks designed to cover any possible adversarial patch of a given size and certifies an image if predictions of all its double-masked versions agree with the ground truth.\n\n    *   **Improving Masking Invariance:**  A key trend is improving a classifier's invariance to masking.  The paper observes that standard Cutout augmentation (randomly masking regions during training) isn't always effective, especially when masks obscure important object features.  Therefore, the authors explore training schemes specifically designed to make models more robust to pixel masking.\n\n    *   **Worst-Case Masking:**  A core trend is the idea of using *worst-case masking* during training.  This involves finding masks that are most likely to cause misclassification and training the model to be robust against those specific masks.  This is in contrast to random masking.\n\n    *   **Greedy Cutout (Proposed Method):** To find these worst-case masks efficiently, the authors propose a *Greedy Cutout* strategy. It's a two-round process to approximate the worst-case masks without an exhaustive search. They show that models trained with Greedy Cutout improve certified robust accuracy compared to random Cutout.  A *Multi-size Greedy Cutout* variation is presented to balance accuracy and computational cost.\n\n*   **Data Augmentation for Robustness:** Data augmentation continues to be a vital trend.  The focus is shifting towards more intelligent and targeted augmentation strategies, such as the proposed Greedy Cutout, rather than purely random methods.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** While the paper's primary focus is on masking, it acknowledges adversarial training (augmenting input with gradients) as a powerful approach for training robust models.\n\n*   **Model Architectures:** The paper tests the proposed method with three different architecture families: ResNet, ViT, ConvNeXt\n\n**Specific Findings & Improvements:**\n\n*   The paper demonstrates that training with \"worst-case\" masking (using Greedy Cutout) significantly improves certified robust accuracy compared to training with random Cutout. For example, on ImageNet with a ViT-B16-224 model, certified robust accuracy increased from 52.5% to 57.7% against a 3% square patch.\n*   The Multi-size Greedy Cutout is efficient to reduce forward passes to achieve competitive certification performance\n\n**Experiments:**\n\n* The paper does several experiments on five popular image classification datasets: ImageNet, ImageNette, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN\n* As in prior work, they report certified defense accuracy for square patches covering 1%, 2%, and 3% of the input image for ImageNet, ImagNette and 0.4%, 2.4% for CIFAR-10, CIFAR100, and SVHN\n\n**Trends Extracted and Summary:**\n\n*   **Emphasis on Certified Robustness:**  Moving beyond empirical defenses to provable guarantees.\n*   **Intelligent Masking:** Shifting from random masking to targeted masking strategies that focus on worst-case scenarios.\n*   **Computational Efficiency:**  Developing efficient methods for finding effective masking strategies.\n*   **Architecture Agnosticism:** Methods are being designed to be compatible with various model architectures.\n\nIn essence, the paper highlights a trend towards more sophisticated and targeted training techniques (like Greedy Cutout) that improve a classifier's inherent robustness to adversarial patches, with a focus on *certified* robustness and computational efficiency."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper \"Towards Practical Certifiable Patch Defense with Vision Transformer\" focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically considering the last 2 years (since the paper appears to be from 2022 based on the references).\n\n**Overall Trend & Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper addresses a critical trend: **moving certifiable adversarial defenses from theoretical possibilities to practical solutions for image classification.** It acknowledges that while defenses exist that can *guarantee* robustness against adversarial patch attacks (certifiable defenses), they often come at a significant cost to *clean accuracy* (performance on normal, unperturbed images) and are not efficient enough for real-world deployment.  The paper aims to bridge this gap.\n\n**Key aspects related to the research question:**\n\n1.  **Problem Addressed: The Accuracy Gap in Certifiable Patch Defenses:**\n    *   Existing certifiable patch defenses have a substantial accuracy gap compared to normal classification models. This limits their practical use.\n    *   The paper cites PatchGuard as an example.  On ImageNet, PatchGuard achieves only 54.6% clean accuracy and 26.0% certified accuracy under 2% patches, much lower than ResNet-50's 76.2% clean accuracy. This is according to the numbers shown in the paper itself, it is worth noting that the paper's conclusion has different results.\n    *   The paper argues a \"breakthrough is needed\" to narrow this gap.\n\n2.  **Proposed Solution: Vision Transformer (ViT) and Derandomized Smoothing (DS) Integration:**\n    *   The paper leverages the recent success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision. ViTs have shown promising performance compared to CNNs, particularly in modeling long-range dependencies in images through self-attention.\n    *   It combines ViTs with Derandomized Smoothing (DS), a classic certifiable patch defense. DS provides high confidence certified robustness by structured ablation.\n    *   The core idea: Integrate ViT into the DS framework to create a more accurate and efficient certifiable patch defense.\n\n3.  **Specific Techniques Introduced:**\n    *   **Progressive Smoothed Image Modeling:** A novel training task for ViTs. This task helps the ViT capture more discriminative local context within an image *while* preserving global semantic information.  The model gradually reconstructs original image tokens from smoothed image bands.\n    *   **Isolated Band Unit Self-Attention:** An architectural modification to ViT's self-attention mechanism to improve inference efficiency.  It restructures the global self-attention into isolated \"band units,\" enabling parallel computation and reducing redundant calculations on smoothed parts of the image. This accelerates inference.\n\n4.  **Experimental Results (Key Performance Metrics):**\n    *   **ImageNet:** The paper reports achieving 78.58% clean accuracy and 41.70% certified accuracy on ImageNet under 2% area patch attacks.  This is presented as a near 1-fold increase over previous methods.\n    *   **CIFAR-10:**  The paper also demonstrates state-of-the-art clean and certified accuracy on CIFAR-10.\n\n5.  **Benchmarking against other techniques:**\n\n    *   The paper compared against Interval Bound Propagation (IBP), Derandomized Smoothing (DS), Clipped BagNet (CBN), Patchguard (PG) and BagCert.\n    *   The paper claims their model ECViT-B surpasses BagCert's clean and certified accuracy by 7.48% and 9.47%.\n\n**Specific References within the Last 2 Years (relevant to adversarial robustness trends):**\n\nThe following papers cited in the \"References\" section are published in 2020, 2021 and 2022 and are related to the topic:\n\n*   **[1] Hangbo Bao, Li Dong, and Furu Wei.

While segmentation isn't image classification directly, the patch attack aspect is relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the most relevant information from the provided paper to answer your research question about recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing specifically on the last 2 years.  I'll extract the key details and organize them for clarity.\n\n**Paper Focus and Limitations**\n\nBefore diving into the trends, it's critical to understand the paper's primary focus:\n\n*   **Semantic Segmentation, Not Image Classification:** This paper primarily addresses *adversarial robustness in semantic segmentation*, a more complex task than image classification.  Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image, while image classification assigns a single label to the entire image.\n\n*   **Patch Attacks:**  The paper specifically targets adversarial *patch attacks*, where a localized region of an image is modified to fool the system.\n\n*   **Certified Defenses:** The paper focuses on *certified defenses*, which provide mathematical guarantees of robustness against a defined threat model (in this case, patch attacks). This is stronger than empirical defenses, which only protect against known attacks.\n\nBecause the primary focus is on semantic segmentation, the direct applicability to *image classification* trends is somewhat limited. However, it cites and builds upon image classification research, so we can extract relevant trends from the related work section and the discussion of techniques.\n\n**Relevant Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Image Classification) from the Last 2 Years (Approximately)**\n\nBased on the citations and discussion within the paper, here are some trends in adversarial robustness for *image classification* that are relevant to your question, focusing on papers published since 2021 (and late 2020):\n\n1.  **Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** A significant amount of research is dedicated to understanding and improving the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs). This is because ViTs have become state-of-the-art in many image recognition tasks but can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\n    *   **Specific Approaches:**\n        *   **Certified Robustness for ViTs:** The paper cites  Chen et al. (2022) as working towards practical certifiable patch defense with vision transformers.\n        *   **PatchVeto (Huang & Li, 2021):** This is a certified detection method tailored for ViT models, implementing masking by removing certain input patches.\n        *   **Smoothed Vision Transformers (Salman et al., 2021):** This paper proposes applying De-Randomized Smoothing (DRS) to Vision Transformers to achieve certified patch robustness.\n    *   **Relevance:**  This highlights the trend of adapting existing certified defense techniques (like randomized smoothing) to the ViT architecture and developing ViT-specific defense mechanisms.\n\n2.  **De-Randomized Smoothing (DRS) and its Variants:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** De-Randomized Smoothing (DRS) (Levine & Feizi, 2020) remains a significant approach for certified defense against patch attacks. It involves training a classifier on masked inputs and using a majority vote at inference time. While Levine & Feizi is outside the last 2 years, the paper references follow-up work.\n    *   **Adaptations:** Salman et al. (2021) applies DRS to Vision Transformers.\n    *   **Limitations:** The paper highlights that DRS-like approaches often require retraining the classifier to handle masked/cropped inputs, which limits the use of pre-trained models.\n\n3.  **Architectural Modifications for Robustness:**\n\n    *   **Trend:**  Exploring network architectures that are inherently more robust to adversarial attacks, particularly patch attacks.\n    *   **BagNets:** The paper mentions BagNets (Brendel & Bethge, 2019) which have small receptive fields, as architectures explored for certified recovery. This involves combining them with fixed postprocessing (Zhang et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2021) or training them end-to-end for certified recovery (Metzen & Yatsura, 2021).\n    *   **Relevance:** This signifies the trend of designing or adapting architectures to be more resistant to adversarial perturbations, even at the cost of some performance on clean data.\n\n4.  **Certified Detection vs. Certified Recovery:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** A recognition of the trade-offs between certified recovery (guaranteeing correct prediction even under attack) and certified detection (guaranteeing detection of the attack).\n    *   **Certified Detection as a Practical Alternative:** The paper suggests that certified detection is often preferable in practice because it allows maintaining higher performance on clean data.\n    *   **Detection Methods:** Minority Reports (McCoyd et al., 2020), PatchGuard++ (Xiang & Mittal, 2021b), ScaleCert (Han et al., 2021), and PatchVeto (Huang & Li, 2021).\n\n5.  **Masking-Based Defenses:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** Using masking strategies as a defense mechanism against patch attacks. This involves masking parts of the input image and making predictions based on the unmasked regions.\n    *   **PatchGuard++ (Xiang & Mittal, 2021b):**  Extends Minority Reports by applying the sliding mask on the feature maps of a BagNet-type feature extractor.\n    *   **PatchCleanser (Xiang et al., 2022a):**  This method can be combined with arbitrary downstream models but is restricted to image classification.\n    *   **Limitations:**  The paper notes that masking-based defenses can be challenging for semantic segmentation because every pixel needs a class assignment, including masked pixels. This motivates the need for inpainting techniques.\n\n6.  **Focus on Defenses Applicable to Arbitrary Models:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** A shift towards developing defenses that can be applied to *any* pre-trained model, rather than requiring specific architectures or retraining.\n    *   **Importance:** This is driven by the practical need to protect existing deployed systems without incurring the cost of retraining.\n    *   **PatchCleanser (Xiang et al., 2022a):** The paper cites this as an example of a defense that works with arbitrary models (but is limited to image classification).\n\n**Summary of Trends**\n\nIn summary, based on the citations and related work within this segmentation-focused paper, recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification include:\n\n*   **ViT-Specific Defenses:**  Developing defenses tailored for Vision Transformer architectures.\n*   **Continued Interest in Smoothing-Based Methods:**  Adapting and refining randomized smoothing techniques like DRS.\n*   **Architectural Considerations:**  Designing or modifying architectures for inherent robustness.\n*   **Practicality of Certified Detection:** Recognizing certified detection as a viable alternative to certified recovery.\n*   **Masking and Patch Removal:** Using masking strategies and patch removal to mitigate the effects of adversarial patches.\n*   **Flexibility and Generalizability:**  Prioritizing defenses that can be applied to arbitrary pre-trained models.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Semantic Segmentation Bias:**  Keep in mind that this information is extracted from a paper primarily focused on semantic segmentation. The specific challenges and solutions in that domain may influence the cited research.\n*   **Limited Scope:** This is not an exhaustive literature review. It's based on the papers cited *within* this particular paper. A broader search would likely reveal additional trends.\n*   **\"Latest\" is Relative:** The field of adversarial robustness is rapidly evolving. Even papers from 2022 might be considered somewhat dated by the time you read this.\n\nI hope this detailed breakdown is helpful!"

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically addressing adversarial patch attacks, and limited to papers from the last 2 years (2022-2024).\n\n**Overall Trend Identified:**\n\nThe paper focuses on the increasing need for *black-box certified defenses* against adversarial patch attacks, which is a shift from earlier white-box methods.  The main trend is moving towards solutions that don't require knowledge of the patch size and location, making them more practical for real-world deployment.\n\n**Specific Information from the Paper (relevant to the question):**\n\n*   **Problem Addressed:** The paper identifies a key limitation of existing architecture-agnostic certified defenses: they require knowledge of the adversarial patch size. This is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This highlights a trend: defenses are evolving to handle more realistic threat models.\n*   **Proposed Solution (IBCD):** To address the black-box problem, the authors propose a two-stage *Iterative Black-box Certified Defense (IBCD)* method.  This embodies the trend towards black-box robustness:\n    *   **Stage 1: Patch Size Estimation:** This stage estimates the patch size using a search-based approach with pixel masking. This iterative approach to estimating the size is a novel aspect.\n    *   **Stage 2: Certified Defense:**  This stage uses existing *white-box* certified defense methods (like PatchCleanser, or derandomized smoothing) *with the estimated patch size* to calculate clean and certified accuracy.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Adaptive Randomized Smoothing: Certified Adversarial Robustness for Multi-Step Defences\n\n**Key Trend: Adaptive Randomized Smoothing (ARS) for Certified Adversarial Robustness**\n\nThe paper introduces Adaptive Randomized Smoothing (ARS) as a novel approach to improve adversarial robustness in image classification, focusing on certified robustness against L\u221e attacks. ARS adapts to inputs at test time while maintaining rigorous provable guarantees, which addresses a major limitation of standard Randomized Smoothing (RS). The research was published in NeurIPS 2024 and considers relevant recent works.\n\n**Details of ARS:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:**  ARS extends Randomized Smoothing (RS) by incorporating test-time adaptivity. Instead of a static smoothing process, ARS adjusts its behavior based on the input it receives.\n*   **Methodology:**\n    *   **Multi-Step Defence:** ARS implements a two-step defense against L\u221e adversaries.  The first step involves computing an input mask to focus on task-relevant information (reducing the input dimension).  The second step then makes a prediction based on the masked image.\n    *   **Differential Privacy (DP) Connection:** ARS reconnects RS to Differential Privacy (DP), specifically f-Differential Privacy (f-DP). This allows for a rigorous analysis of multi-step adaptive computations, leveraging DP's composition properties.\n    *   **Masking Function:** ARS uses a masking function `w(.)` to adaptively reduce the value of less important pixels (reducing the \"attack surface\" for an L\u221e attacker) during the smoothing process. This is implemented via a U-Net architecture. The mask is learned to ignore the background and reduce the effective dimension of the input.\n    *   **Noise Budget Splitting:** ARS splits the noise budget `\u03c3` between the two steps of the process (M1 and M2), enabling better control of the noise levels applied to the input.\n    *   **Mechanism Output Averaging:** ARS takes a weighted average of the outputs from both steps (M1 and M2) to ensure that information from both steps is fully leveraged.\n*   **Advantages Claimed:**\n    *   **Improved Accuracy:** ARS improves standard test accuracy by 1 to 15% points on CIFAR-10, and up to 7.7% on CelebA, and improves certified test accuracy by up to 1.6% on ImageNet compared to standard RS without adaptivity.\n    *   **Provable Robustness:** ARS provides rigorous bounds on adversarial robustness, unlike many other adaptive defenses that are heuristic and lack formal guarantees.\n    *   **High-Dimensional Adaptivity:** ARS allows flexible adaptation through high-dimensional input-dependent masking.\n    *   **Addresses Dimensionality Limitations:** The adaptive dimension reduction in the first step helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality that RS suffers from in high-dimensional image classification tasks (especially with L\u221e attacks).\n*   **Theoretical Basis:**  The paper provides a formal theory for ARS, including theorems and propositions that demonstrate its robustness properties. The core theoretical contribution is Theorem 2.3 (Adaptive RS), which shows there is no cost to adaptivity in terms of certified radius.\n*   **L\u221e Specificity:** Adaptive masking technique provides improved certificates for the L\u221e norm, but does not have the same effect for other norms such as L2.\n\n**Benchmarking and Datasets:**\n\n*   **CIFAR-10:** The authors create a challenging \"20kBG\" benchmark by superimposing CIFAR-10 images onto larger distractor background images.  This increases the input dimension and tests the ability of ARS to focus on relevant information.\n*   **CelebA:** The authors use the CelebA face dataset in an unaligned version, randomly cropping images to create spatial variation in the mouth position. This makes it challenging to localize the features of interest.\n*   **ImageNet:** The authors evaluate the scalability of ARS on the standard large-scale ImageNet dataset.\n\n**Comparison with Other Methods:**\n\nThe paper explicitly compares ARS to:\n\n*   **Standard Randomized Smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019):** ARS aims to improve upon this by adding adaptivity.\n*   **UniCR (Hong et al., 2022):**  While UniCR adapts the noise distribution, the test-time adaptation is not sound.\n*   **Input-Dependent Variance Adjustment (S\u00faken\u00edk et al., 2021):** This approach provides only minimal adaptivity with only minor improvements to certification.\n*   **Static Mask:** A baseline that learns a fixed mask during training that does not adapt during testing.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   Increased model size and computation compared to standard RS.\n\n**Implications and Future Directions:**\n\n*   ARS provides a framework for analyzing existing heuristic adaptive defenses.\n*   ARS could enable the formal analysis of input purification techniques.\n\n**Key Papers Referenced (Published Within the Last 2 Years):**\nSeveral recent papers are cited, demonstrating the relevance of this work to current research:\n\n*   **Costa et al.

It introduces the concept of 'sample attackability', aiming to identify vulnerable and robust samples, which is a relevant trend in understanding and improving adversarial robustness.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overview of the Paper's Contribution to the Field**\n\nThis paper addresses a critical, yet often overlooked, aspect of adversarial robustness: understanding the inherent attackability/robustness of *input data* itself, independent of specific models or attacks.  Instead of focusing solely on attack generation or defense mechanisms, the paper introduces the concept of \"sample attackability.\" This involves identifying which samples are inherently more susceptible to adversarial attacks (attackable samples) and which are more resistant (robust samples).  The authors propose a deep learning-based \"attackability detector\" to achieve this.\n\n**Relevance to Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Last 2 Years)**\n\nThe paper contributes to several current trends in adversarial robustness research, particularly those focusing on improving the *efficiency* and *effectiveness* of defense mechanisms.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Data-Centric Perspective on Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n    *   The paper highlights a shift in focus from solely model-centric defenses to a more data-aware approach. This aligns with a broader trend recognizing that the properties of input data significantly influence model vulnerability. By understanding which *samples* are most vulnerable, defenses can be targeted more effectively. This perspective is explicitly mentioned in the introduction: \"However, little or no work has sought to understand adversarial attacks from an input-data perspective. In particular, it is unclear why some samples are more susceptible to attacks than others.\"\n    *   This contrasts with earlier work (pre-2021) that primarily focused on modifying model architecture, training procedures, or adding layers for adversarial detection. This paper adds a data understanding element.\n\n2.  **Improving Adversarial Training Efficiency:**\n\n    *   *Weighted Adversarial Training:* The paper directly addresses the trend of \"weighted adversarial training.\"  The introduction mentions that adversarial training can be made more efficient by focusing on the most attackable samples. This is a crucial trend because standard adversarial training is computationally expensive. The paper cites Holtz et al. (2022) as related work. The method proposed in this paper is a novel approach of improving adversarial training by weighting the samples and predicting perturbation sizes for non-adversarial samples.\n    *   The paper explicitly links sample attackability to improving adversarial training efficiency.  By identifying the most attackable samples, adversarial training can be focused on these, potentially reducing overall training time without sacrificing robustness.  This is described in the introduction: \"adversarial training can be made more efficient by augmenting with adversarial examples for only the most attackable samples to avoid unnecessarily scaling training times, i.e. a variant of weighted adversarial training\".\n    *   *Active Adversarial Training:* The paper proposes an active adversarial training method where a subset of the most useful samples are used for adversarial training. Results shown in Figure 3 demonstrate that with the proposed approach the model becomes most robust while using a smaller fraction of the data for training.\n\n3.  **Beyond Uncertainty as a Proxy for Attackability:**\n\n    *   The paper challenges the common practice of using model uncertainty (e.g., entropy) as a direct indicator of a sample's vulnerability to adversarial attacks. The abstract and introduction state that the deep attackability detector performs better than simple model uncertainty-based measures. This suggests that uncertainty alone is an inadequate proxy for measuring sample distance to a decision boundary. This is an important trend because many earlier defenses relied heavily on uncertainty measures. The paper cites Kim et al. (2021) and Gawlikowski et al. (2021) to show this.\n    *   The paper states, \"This suggests that uncertainty is an inadequate proxy for measuring sample distance to a decision boundary.\"\n\n4.  **Emphasis on Generalization and Transferability:**\n\n    *   The paper's approach focuses on building an attackability detector that is agnostic to specific model architectures and attack methods.  This is crucial for real-world deployment where models and attack strategies are constantly evolving. The abstract indicates that the detector is evaluated on unseen datasets and target models.\n    *   This generalizability is a key trend because many earlier defenses were tailored to specific model architectures or attack types, making them brittle in practice. The abstract mentions portability of the deep attackability detector.\n\n**Key Components of the Proposed Approach**\n\n*   **Sample Attackability Definition:** Defines attackability based on the *smallest* perturbation size required to change a sample's classification.\n*   **Deep Learning-Based Detector:**  A neural network trained to predict the attackability of a sample, given its encoded representation from another (seen) model.\n*   **Universally Attackable/Robust Samples:** Extends the attackability definition to identify samples that are consistently attackable or robust across multiple models.\n*   **Evaluation Methodology:** Rigorous evaluation using different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), model architectures (including unseen target models), and attack methods (FGSM, PGD). Different evaluation settings are considered: all, uni, spec, vspec.\n\n**Specific References to Recent Work (Last 2 Years)**\n\nThe paper explicitly cites the following papers published in the last 2 years (2021-2023) that are relevant to adversarial robustness trends:\n\n*   **Bai et al. (2021):** \"Recent advances in adversarial training for adversarial robustness.\"  This paper likely provides a survey or overview of current adversarial training techniques.\n*   **Gawlikowski et al. (2021):** \"A survey of uncertainty in deep neural networks.\" This paper highlights the trend of using uncertainty estimation in DNNs.\n*   **Holtz et al. (2022):** \"Learning sample reweighting for accuracy and adversarial robustness.\"  Relevant to the trend of weighted adversarial training.\n*   **Huynh et al.

(2022):** \"Towards adversarially robust text classifiers by learning to reweight clean examples.\" Provides a survey for adversarial training.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe paper focuses on image classification.  The trends identified may not directly translate to other domains (e.g., NLP). Also, this paper was submitted in 2023 so it may miss the very latest advancements in the field from late 2023 or 2024.\n\n**In summary,** the paper contributes to the latest trends in adversarial robustness by: (1) introducing a data-centric perspective, (2) improving adversarial training efficiency, (3) moving beyond uncertainty as a sole proxy for attackability, and (4) emphasizing the importance of generalization and transferability of defenses."

      "relevancy": "Published in 2022, this paper analyzes adversarial training for video classification and proposes three defenses against attacks with variable attack budgets. The exploration of adversarial training techniques and defenses against adaptive adversaries is relevant to the research question.",
      "summary": "The paper \"Analysis and Extensions of Adversarial Training for Video Classification\" by Kinfu and Vidal, published within the last 2 years (with references as recent as 2021), presents findings relevant to the research question about recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, although the focus is on *video* classification. While the paper's primary focus is on video classification, several concepts and techniques are relevant and applicable to image classification as well, especially concerning adversarial training.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information extracted from the paper, focusing on trends and techniques applicable, or adaptable, to image classification:\n\n**1. Adversarial Training (AT) as a Core Defense:**\n\n*   **Trend:** The paper reaffirms Adversarial Training (AT) as a leading defense method against adversarial attacks. It explicitly states AT \"shows state-of-the-art adversarial robustness.\" This reinforces AT's continued importance as a core technique.  The paper focuses on analyzing and extending AT, which implicitly validates its ongoing relevance.\n*   **Description:** AT involves augmenting the training dataset with adversarial examples generated to maximize the classification loss. The model is then trained on this augmented dataset to become more robust.  The goal is to solve a min-max optimization problem (Equation 5) where the inner maximization generates optimal adversarial examples, and the outer minimization trains the model to be robust to them.\n*   **Relevance to Image Classification:** AT is a well-established technique in image classification, and the analysis of its properties and potential improvements in the video domain can often be transferred to image classification.\n\n**2. Sensitivity of Optimal Attacks and Importance of Parameter Tuning:**\n\n*   **Trend:**  The paper highlights a critical aspect of generating effective adversarial examples: the sensitivity to attack parameters like step size.  It's not enough to simply use an attack algorithm; careful tuning is *essential*.\n*   **Findings:**\n    *   The optimal step size in Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks is linearly related to the attack budget (epsilon).  The paper presents a linear relationship: `\u02c6\u03b1 \u2248 0.2(\u03f5 + 1)` where `\u02c6\u03b1` is the optimal step size and `\u03f5` is the attack budget (Figure 2).\n    *   A small step size leads to weak attacks, while overly large step sizes can also reduce attack strength.\n    *   Adversarial loss surfaces reveal the narrow range of effective step sizes.\n*   **Relevance to Image Classification:** This is crucial for image classification. Many studies might not emphasize the level of fine-tuning required for generating truly effective adversarial examples. This finding suggests that previously reported results might be improved by more careful parameter selection.\n\n**3. Sub-Optimal Attacks Can Lead to Better Generalization:**\n\n*   **Trend:**  Counterintuitively, the paper demonstrates that using *sub-optimal* attacks during adversarial training can lead to *better* robustness at test time. Training with the strongest possible (optimal) attacks doesn't always yield the best results.\n*   **Findings:**\n    *   AT with a smaller (sub-optimal) attack budget during training leads to more robust performance at test time.  Using a higher attack budget during training does *not* necessarily lead to better defense.\n    *   The step size in sub-optimal regions controls the trade-off between standard accuracy and robustness.\n*   **Relevance to Image Classification:**  This is a significant finding.  It suggests a need to re-evaluate the common practice of always trying to generate the most potent adversarial examples during training.  Exploration of using weaker, more diverse attacks could lead to improved generalization and robustness. This is related to overfitting the adversarial examples.\n\n**4. Adaptive and Curriculum-Based Adversarial Training:**\n\n*   **Trend:** The paper proposes Adaptive Adversarial Training (AAT) and Curriculum Adversarial Training (CAT) as improvements to standard AT. These methods dynamically adjust the attack strategy during training.\n*   **AAT:** Samples attack types or budgets from a distribution that is adapted based on the model's performance against different attacks.  The probability of using a specific attack budget is adjusted based on the loss observed for that budget.\n*   **CAT:** Gradually increases the attack budget as training progresses. This is intended to avoid overfitting to easier attacks and gradually challenge the model with stronger attacks.\n*   **Relevance to Image Classification:** These methods introduce a dynamic element to AT, which can be beneficial for image classification. Instead of using a fixed attack strategy, the training adapts to the model's learning progress and vulnerability profile.\n\n**5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Robustness:**\n\n*   **Trend:**  The paper investigates the use of GANs for defending against adversarial attacks, specifically through Adversarial Perturbation Elimination (APE-GAN).\n*   **APE-GAN:** Trains a GAN to remove perturbations from adversarial examples, mapping adversarial data back to the clean data manifold. The generator network is trained to reconstruct a clean video from an adversarial one, while a discriminator distinguishes between real and reconstructed videos.\n*   **Generative AT (GAT):** An end-to-end integration of APE-GAN and AT, where the GAN cleans the input before it enters the classifier, and both are trained adversarially.\n*   **Relevance to Image Classification:** GAN-based defenses have been explored in image classification, and this work contributes by exploring the effectiveness of APE-GAN and its integration with AT. It suggests that cleaning the input data using a GAN before classification can improve robustness.\n\n**6. Robustness to Multiple Attack Types:**\n\n*   **Trend:**  The paper highlights the importance of robustness against multiple attack types, as a defense effective against one attack may be vulnerable to others.\n*   **Findings:** AAT provides robustness to multiple attack types and Generative Adaptive AT boosts the robustness\n*   **Relevance to Image Classification:** This is a critical consideration in image classification defense. A robust defense should not only be effective against a specific attack but should also generalize to other, potentially unknown, attacks.\n\n**Summary of Trends for Image Classification (from this paper's perspective):**\n\n1.  **AT Remains Central:** Adversarial Training is still a foundational technique.\n2.  **Attack Parameter Tuning:** Careful parameter selection for adversarial attacks is vital. The optimal step size and its relationship with the attack budget are important to consider.\n3.  **Sub-Optimal Attacks:** Training with sub-optimal attacks can improve generalization and robustness.\n4.  **Dynamic Training:** Adaptive and curriculum-based AT methods offer potential improvements by dynamically adjusting the attack strategy during training.\n5.  **GAN-Based Preprocessing:** GANs can be used to clean adversarial perturbations, potentially improving robustness.\n6.  **Multi-Attack Robustness:** Defenses should be evaluated against a diverse range of attack types.\n\nWhile the paper focuses on video, these trends directly inform research into adversarial robustness for image classification.  The insights regarding parameter tuning, sub-optimal attacks, and dynamic training strategies are particularly valuable and suggest promising avenues for future research."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on papers from the last 2 years, even though this paper is about text and not images:\n\n**Relevance to Image Classification Robustness (Indirect):**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on adversarial robustness in *text classification*, using techniques inspired by successes in *image* classification, specifically drawing on diffusion models. Therefore, while not directly addressing image classification, it highlights a trend of *transferring* robustness techniques from the image domain to the text domain.  This suggests a broader trend of cross-pollination of ideas between the two fields.\n\n**Key Takeaways Regarding Transfer of Techniques:**\n\n*   **Diffusion Models as Inspiration:** The core idea is using diffusion models (successful in image robustness) as inspiration for text defense.  Diffusion models work by \"denoising\" data; in the image context, this means adding and removing noise to mitigate adversarial attacks.  The authors draw inspiration from this for their text-based defense.\n*   **Stochastic Purification:**  The paper notes the success of stochastic purification in computer vision [3,27,32]. The MaskPure method uses stochastic purification inspired by diffusion-based adversarial defenses in the image setting.\n*   **Masking and De-masking Analogy:**  The authors draw a parallel between the \"noising and de-noising\" process of diffusion models in images and the \"masking and de-masking\" of tokens in text. The MaskPure approach masks and refills tokens, mimicking the diffusion-based defenses used for images.\n\n**Cited Papers Potentially Relevant to Image Classification (Check Dates):**\n\nThe paper cites several works that might be relevant if they fall within the last 2 years, BUT THEY ARE LIKELY TO NOT BE RELEVANT SINCE THIS PAPER IS ABOUT TEXT:\n\n*   **[3,27,32]:** These are cited as examples of successful diffusion model applications for mitigating adversarial attacks in *computer vision*.  You would need to find these specific papers and check their publication dates to assess relevance.\n    *   If they discuss specific architectures, training methods, or theoretical justifications for diffusion-based image defense, they would be highly relevant.\n*   **Nie et al. [27]:** Mentioned in Section 6 as a work that proves (under constraints) that the L2 distance between a diffusion-purified adversarial sample and the original clean sample is bounded. If this paper is within the last 2 years, it's very relevant to the theoretical understanding of diffusion-based robustness.\n\n**General Trends Implied (But Not Explicitly Stated for Images):**\n\nBased on the paper's approach, one can infer these potential trends in image classification robustness:\n\n*   **Generative Models for Defense:** Using generative models like diffusion models for adversarial defense is a promising direction. The success in text suggests continued exploration in images.\n*   **Stochasticity:** Incorporating randomness (stochasticity) in defense mechanisms is a valuable strategy.\n*   **Theoretical Justification:** There's a growing interest in providing theoretical guarantees (certified robustness) for defense methods, moving beyond purely empirical evaluations.\n*   **Transfer Learning (Between Domains):**  Techniques developed in one domain (e.g., images) can be adapted and applied to other domains (e.g., text).\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   **Indirect Relevance:** The paper itself does not directly discuss recent trends in image classification robustness.  The information is gleaned from the *inspiration* drawn from image techniques for a text-based defense.\n*   **Citation Dates:**  The relevance of cited papers depends entirely on their publication dates.\n\n**How to Use This Information:**\n\n1.  **Identify and Retrieve Cited Papers:** Find the full citations for [3], [27], and [32].  Check their publication dates. If they are within the last 2 years, they are directly relevant.\n2.  **Focus on Diffusion Models:**  Search for recent (last 2 years) papers specifically on diffusion models for adversarial robustness in image classification.  Keywords: \"diffusion models,\" \"adversarial robustness,\" \"image classification,\" \"certified robustness.\"\n3.  **Explore Stochastic Defenses:** Look for papers exploring other stochastic defenses in image classification, as the paper highlights the importance of randomness.\n4.  **Cross-Domain Transfer:** Consider searching for papers that explicitly discuss the transfer of techniques between image and text domains for adversarial robustness.\n\nIn summary, while this paper is focused on text, it provides valuable pointers to potential trends in image classification robustness *if* the cited papers are recent and if you focus on the underlying principles (diffusion models, stochasticity, theoretical guarantees) that are being transferred between the domains."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** MultiGuard: Provably Robust Multi-label Classification against Adversarial Examples\n\n**Publication Date:**  The paper was presented at the 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).  This falls within the last 2 years (from today: October 27, 2024).\n\n**Key Areas & Trends Addressed:**\n\n*   **Provable Robustness:** The paper focuses on *provable* defenses against adversarial examples.  This is a significant trend, shifting away from empirical defenses that are often broken by stronger attacks.\n*   **Randomized Smoothing:** MultiGuard leverages *randomized smoothing*, which the paper identifies as a \"state-of-the-art technique\" for building provably robust classifiers.  This confirms randomized smoothing as a prominent technique.\n*   **Multi-label Classification:**  The paper specifically addresses adversarial robustness in the *multi-label classification* setting. This is important because most earlier provable defenses focused on *multi-class* classification. The paper explicitly states that extending multi-class defenses to multi-label scenarios leads to sub-optimal robustness guarantees. Thus, it's a trend to adapt adversarial robustness techniques to more complex classification tasks.\n*   **Certified Robustness Metrics:**  The paper introduces *certified* top-k precision, recall, and f1-score as evaluation metrics. This highlights a trend toward *certifying* the performance of defenses under attack, rather than just measuring empirical robustness.\n*   **\u21132-Norm Bounded Perturbations:** MultiGuard provides robustness guarantees against adversarial perturbations bounded by the \u21132-norm. This is a common threat model considered in adversarial robustness research.\n\n**Core Contributions & Technical Details:**\n\n*   **MultiGuard Defense:**  The paper proposes MultiGuard, a provably robust defense for multi-label classification based on randomized smoothing. It adds isotropic Gaussian noise to the input.\n\n*   **Theoretical Contribution (Certified Intersection Size):** The main theoretical result is a bound on the *certified intersection size*. This measures the minimum number of ground truth labels that are guaranteed to be among the top-k labels predicted by MultiGuard, even under adversarial perturbation.  The paper emphasizes that existing randomized smoothing techniques are sub-optimal when directly applied to multi-label classification.\n\n*   **Technical Novelty:**\n    *   A variant of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma is developed that is applicable to multiple functions, corresponding to the multiple labels predicted by the base classifier.\n    *   The law of contraposition is used to simultaneously consider multiple ground truth labels when deriving the certified intersection size.\n\n*   **Monte Carlo Algorithm:** A Monte Carlo algorithm is designed to estimate lower/upper bounds on label probabilities. The Clopper-Pearson method (from statistics) is used for binomial proportion confidence interval estimation. This addresses the challenge of computing exact label probabilities due to the complexity of the base classifiers and the continuous nature of the Gaussian noise.\n*   **Datasets:** Evaluation is performed on VOC 2007, MS-COCO, and NUS-WIDE datasets.\n*   **Base Classifier:** ASL (Asymmetric Loss) is used to train the base multi-label classifiers.\n*   **Comparison:**  MultiGuard is compared against an extension of Jia et al. (2020) to multi-label classification, demonstrating improved performance.\n\n**Insights into Key Parameters & Trade-offs:**\n\n*   **k' (Number of labels predicted by the base classifier):** A larger k' increases performance without attacks but reduces robustness against adversarial examples.\n\n*   **k (Number of labels predicted by the smoothed classifier):** A larger k provides a trade-off between certified top-k precision without attacks and robustness.\n\n*   **\u03c3 (Standard deviation of the Gaussian noise):**  A larger \u03c3 also offers a trade-off between performance without attacks and robustness.\n\n*   **n (Number of noisy samples) and \u03b1 (Confidence level):**  Increasing n and \u03b1 improves certified robustness.\n\n**Limitations & Future Work (Implied Trends):**\n\n*   The authors suggest future work on incorporating knowledge of the base multi-label classifier and designing new methods to train more accurate base multi-label classifiers. This points towards a trend of integrating model-specific knowledge to boost robustness.\n\n**Why This Paper Is Relevant:**\n\n*   **Recent Publication Date:**  The 2022 NeurIPS publication date ensures that the paper represents recent advances.\n\n*   **Directly Addresses Adversarial Robustness:**  The entire focus is on defending against adversarial examples.\n\n*   **Focus on Multi-Label Classification:** Addresses a more realistic and complex image classification scenario than traditional multi-class.\n\n*   **Provable Guarantees:**  Emphasizes provable robustness, a crucial trend for security-critical applications.\n\n**In summary, this paper reflects the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years:**\n\n1.  **Emphasis on Provable Robustness:** Moving beyond empirical defenses.\n2.  **Randomized Smoothing:** A leading technique for achieving provable robustness.\n3.  **Extending Robustness to Multi-Label Classification:** Addressing the limitations of applying multi-class techniques to more complex scenarios.\n4.  **Certified Metrics:**  Using metrics that provide guarantees on performance under attack.\n5.  **Exploration of Trade-offs:** Balancing robustness with performance under normal conditions.\n6.  **Incorporating Model-Specific Knowledge:** A potential future direction."

DIP offers a way to mitigate this vulnerability without retraining the classifier (training-free) and in an attack-agnostic manner.\n\n**DIPDefend's Approach:**\n\n1.  **DIP Modeling:** A DIP network, specific to an adversarial example, reconstructs the image. The reconstruction process seeks a function that maps Gaussian noise to a reconstructed image, optimizing until a reconstructed image is found.\n2.  **Cross-Boundary Image Detection:** The method maps the DIP trace (the sequence of reconstructed images during DIP optimization) to the decision space of the victim classifier. It identifies \"cross-boundary images\" in the DIP trace \u2013 points where the classifier's prediction changes.\n3.  **On-Boundary Image Search:**  The method searches for images lying on the decision boundary by interpolating between cross-boundary images.\n4.  **On-Manifold Image Stitching:** The defense refines the reconstructed image by moving a small step along the reverse direction to the adversarial example.

While focused on 3D point clouds, the application of randomized smoothing to achieve provable robustness is a key trend in adversarial defense that is relevant to image classification.",
      "summary": "Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the paper, addressing your research question about the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper addresses the vulnerability of 3D point cloud classifiers to adversarial attacks. It specifically focuses on attacks involving modifying, adding, or deleting points in a 3D point cloud. This differs from *image classification*, which is usually 2D.\n*   The paper introduces \"PointGuard,\" a defense mechanism that aims to provide provable robustness guarantees against these types of attacks in 3D point clouds.\n\n**Relevance to Image Classification (and Limitations):**\n\n*   While the paper's primary focus is 3D point clouds, it draws parallels and contrasts with techniques used in 2D image classification.  Specifically, it discusses Randomized Smoothing, a state-of-the-art technique for building provably robust 2D image classifiers, and explores its applicability (and limitations) to 3D point cloud data. *This is the key area where the paper touches on trends relevant to image classification.*\n\n**Key Takeaways Regarding Adversarial Robustness Trends (as related to image classification):**\n\n1.  **Randomized Smoothing:**\n\n    *   The paper identifies Randomized Smoothing as a *major trend* in building provably robust image classifiers. The general idea is to add random noise (e.g., Gaussian noise) to an image before classification.\n    *   *Provable robustness* means that the classifier can be certified to predict the same label for an image even when adversarial perturbations (within a certain bound) are added.\n    *   The paper acknowledges the effectiveness of randomized smoothing for image classification, citing multiple works: \\[1, 19, 13, 16, 4, 25, 22, 14, 15, 11, 29]. This reinforces its status as a prominent technique.\n    *   **Limitation:** The paper highlights a key limitation of directly applying randomized smoothing to 3D point clouds: It typically requires the input size (number of points/pixels) to remain unchanged under attack. This makes it unsuitable for attacks that add or delete points (which *are* common in 3D point cloud scenarios).\n    *   The core idea is to add noise to input data and then apply a standard classifier, using statistical analysis to provide robustness guarantees. This contrasts with other approaches like adversarial training (training classifiers on adversarially perturbed data).\n\n2.  **Certified Defenses:**\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes the need for *certified defenses* that provide provable robustness guarantees. This is a trend driven by the fact that many empirical defenses (those that aim to detect attacks or train more robust classifiers) are often broken by more advanced attacks.\n    *   Certified robustness means that a classifier can *certifiably* predict the same label for an input, even when it is subjected to a certain level of adversarial perturbation (e.g., a bounded number of modified pixels/points, or a perturbation within a certain \u21132 norm).\n\n**Why these are considered trends:**\n\n*   The frequent mentions of Randomized Smoothing and certified defenses in the \"Background and Related Work\" section, along with associated citations, indicate that these are active areas of research.\n*   The paper positions its \"PointGuard\" defense as a contribution to the area of *certified defenses*, implying that this is a desirable property that the research community is striving for.\n\n**Specifics About Randomized Smoothing from Citation \\[4]:**\n\n*   Citation \\[4] is to a paper by Cohen et al. specifically on certified adversarial robustness via randomized smoothing.  This paper (likely from 2019, based on the abstract's information) is a key reference for understanding the specifics of this technique in the context of image classification.  It involves adding isotropic Gaussian noise with mean 0 and standard deviation \u03c3 to an image before classification. The \"certified radius\" is the maximum \u21132-norm of the adversarial perturbation for which the classifier can guarantee a correct prediction.\n\n**How PointGuard Relates to Image Classification Trends:**\n\n*   PointGuard can be viewed as an attempt to adapt principles from randomized smoothing (which is successful in image classification) to a different data modality (3D point clouds).\n*   The core idea of PointGuard (subsampling and majority voting) shares some conceptual similarities with ensemble methods used in image classification to improve robustness.\n\n**Limitations of Relevance:**\n\n*   The primary focus of this paper is *not* image classification. While it mentions image classification techniques, it does so in the context of motivating and contrasting its approach to 3D point cloud classification.\n*   The paper doesn't delve into the *latest advances* within Randomized Smoothing for image classification. It uses Randomized Smoothing as a baseline or point of comparison.\n*   It doesn't discuss other contemporary trends in adversarial robustness for *image classification* such as adversarial training methods in detail.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe paper indicates that Randomized Smoothing is a leading trend in achieving provable adversarial robustness for image classification. It also points to the broader goal of developing *certified defenses*. However, the main thrust of the paper is about adapting these concepts to the challenges of 3D point cloud classification, where attacks like point addition/deletion require different defensive strategies."

The paper also proposes that an attacker can force a pre-trained generator to repeat instances outside the domain if supported by appropriate adversarial inputs.\n*   **Adversarial Perturbations for Privacy Protection:** The paper discusses the use of adversarial perturbations *before* images are posted online to make it harder for deepfake models to use those images (Shan et al. \\[17]).  This aims to prevent unauthorized training of deepfake models using personal data.\n*   **Attacking Image Translation Networks:** The paper highlights Yeh et al. \\[18] who used adversarial attacks against image translation networks (CycleGAN, pix2pix, etc.).

However, it identifies a weakness: these models are often vulnerable to black-box attacks.\n*   **Proposed Solution:** A novel method is introduced using a random ensemble of encrypted Vision Transformers (ViTs). The method is designed to improve robustness against both white-box and black-box attacks.\n*   **Evaluation Metric:** The paper uses AutoAttack, a benchmark attack method, to objectively test adversarial robustness.\n*   **Datasets:** The method is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.\n*   **Key Result:** The proposed method outperforms conventional defenses in terms of both clean accuracy and robust accuracy, according to the RobustBench benchmark.\n\n**Key Components & Techniques (Relevant to Recent Trends)**\n\n1.  **Vision Transformers (ViTs):**\n    *   ViTs are highlighted as a promising architecture for adversarial robustness, inspired by their success in NLP.\n    *   Specific properties of ViTs that enhance robustness:\n        *   High performance in image classification compared to CNNs.\n        *   Low transferability between ViT and CNN models.\n        *   Low transferability among ViT models encrypted with different keys.\n        *   Similarity to block-wise image encryption.\n    *   The patch embedding structure of ViTs is noted as contributing to these properties.\n\n2.  **Ensemble Methods:**\n    *   The paper proposes a *random* ensemble of encrypted ViTs.

It identifies that existing Lipschitz bounding methods are computationally prohibitive for such large networks.\n*   **Proposed Method:** They introduce \"CertViT,\" a two-step proximal-projection method to achieve certified robustness from pre-trained weights.

Relevant Trends in Adversarial Robustness (as discussed/addressed in the paper)**\n\n1.  **Certified Robustness via Lipschitz Bounding:**\n    *   **Trend:** A significant area of research focuses on estimating and bounding the Lipschitz constant of neural networks to provide formal guarantees of robustness.  The paper positions itself within this trend.\n    *   **Global vs. Local Lipschitz Constants:**  The paper notes the trade-offs between global Lipschitz bounds (computationally cheap but often loose) and local Lipschitz estimates (tighter but harder to compute).\n    *   **Limitations of Existing Lipschitz Methods:**  Existing methods are primarily applied to smaller networks with convolutional and dense layers and are often trained from scratch. Scalability to large transformers is a problem.\n\n2.  **Adversarial Robustness of Transformers:**\n    *   **Trend:** The paper acknowledges growing interest in the empirical robustness of transformers and the development of adversarial attacks specifically designed to fool them. However, the *theoretical* robustness properties (like Lipschitz bounds) of transformers are not well-studied.\n    *   **Attention Mechanism:** The paper highlights that standard dot-product self-attention is *not* Lipschitz continuous, posing a challenge for certified robustness.\n    *   **Specific Attacks on Transformers:** The paper references the Self-Attention Gradient Attack (SAGA) as a method used to attack ensembles of transformers and CNNs.\n\n3.  **Adversarial Robustness of Pre-Trained Classifiers:**\n    *   **Trend:** Leveraging pre-trained models for robustness is an area of investigation.\n    *   **Denoised Smoothing:** The paper mentions denoised smoothing as a technique to make pre-trained classifiers robust without retraining, by prepending a Gaussian denoiser and applying randomized smoothing.  The limitation is its primary applicability to \u21132 bounded perturbations.\n\n**III. Comparison to Other Methods (Important for understanding the landscape)**\n\nThe paper extensively compares CertViT to other Lipschitz bounding methods, specifically:\n\n*   **GloRo (Globally-Robust Neural Networks):** Bounds the upper bounds on the worst margins using the global Lipschitz constant.\n*   **Local-Lip:** Utilizes interactions between activation functions and weight matrices to guarantee a lower provable local Lipschitz bound.\n*   **BCP (Box Constrained Propagation):** Achieves a tighter outer bound than global Lipschitz bounds by considering local information via interval bound propagation.\n*   **LMT (Lipschitz Margin Training):** Trains networks that are certifiably robust by constructing a loss on worst logits.\n\n**IV. Technical Details Relevant to Robustness**\n\n*   **Lipschitz Continuity (Definition):** The paper provides a formal definition of the Lipschitz constant, which is fundamental to the certified robustness approach.\n*   **Global Lipschitz Bound:** The paper presents the standard formula for calculating the global Lipschitz bound of a neural network as the product of the spectral norms of the weight matrices in each layer.\n*   **L2 Multi-Headed Self-Attention (L2-MHA):** This is a key component, as the paper replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with L2-MHA to achieve Lipschitz continuity in the transformer architecture.\n*   **GELU Activation:** The paper considers the Lipschitz constant of the GELU activation function, which is used in the MLP layers of transformers.\n\n**V. Experimental Setup and Results (Key for evaluating the trends)**\n\n*   **Datasets:** MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K.\n*   **Architectures:** Custom CNNs, Vision Transformers (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformers (DeiT), and Swin Transformers.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   **Clean Accuracy:** Accuracy on non-perturbed inputs.\n    *   **PGD Accuracy:** Accuracy on adversarially perturbed inputs generated by the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack.  PGD is a strong first-order iterative attack.\n    *   **Certified Accuracy:** The proportion of inputs that can be correctly classified *and* certified within an \u03f5-ball (i.e., provably robust).\n    *   **Lipschitz Constant:** The estimated Lipschitz constant of the network.\n    *   **FLOPs:** Floating point operations, a measure of computational cost.\n\n**VI. Limitations and Future Directions (Implied by the paper)**\n\n*   **Loose Lipschitz Bounds:** The paper acknowledges that the calculated Lipschitz bounds are upper bounds, which can be loose and increase with the network's depth and parameters. This limits the certified accuracy, especially for larger models. This suggests the need for tighter Lipschitz estimation techniques.\n*   **Scaling CertViT:** While CertViT demonstrates promise, further research is needed to improve its scalability to even larger transformer models and more complex datasets.\n*  **PGD accuracy vs Certified accuracy:** In most cases, only PGD accuracy could be improved, but not certified accuracy.\n*   **Dependency on L2 Attention:**\n    *   The method relies on replacing standard dot-product attention with L2 attention, potentially impacting performance if L2 attention is not as effective in some scenarios.\n*   **CertViT FLOPs:** CertViT still has considerable FLOPs requirements, which should be improved.\n\n**In summary, based on this paper, the latest trends include:**\n\n*   Focus on **certified robustness** using Lipschitz bounds.\n*   Specific focus on **transformers** and their unique challenges (non-Lipschitz attention).\n*   Exploration of **pre-trained models** to improve robustness without training from scratch.\n*   The research trends focus on **achieving good trade-offs** between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, as most methods lead to decreased accuracy.\n*   Research trends focus on **improving PGD accuracy vs certified accuracy**."

      "relevancy": "This paper discusses distributed black-box attacks against cloud APIs for image classification, providing insights into the practical threats and challenges in adversarial robustness.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on *black-box adversarial attacks* against image classification models, specifically those deployed as cloud APIs. It investigates the *practical threat* these attacks pose, considering factors like attack time and success rate in a realistic cloud environment. The authors identify common mistakes in prior research that lead to overestimation of attack effectiveness and propose methods to accelerate black-box attacks against cloud services. The focus is **NOT** on new defense mechanisms, but on more efficient attack methodologies.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness Trends (with a Black-box Attack Perspective):**\n\nWhile the paper doesn't directly address *defenses* for adversarial robustness, it highlights trends related to making attacks *more practical* and therefore *more concerning*, which implicitly drives the need for better defenses. Key trends gleaned from this paper within the last 2 years (as of the paper's writing) regarding attacking image classifiers include:\n\n1.  **Moving Towards Realistic Attack Scenarios:**  A major trend is the shift from evaluating attacks on *local models* to *online attacks against cloud APIs*. This is crucial because:\n\n    *   *Image Encoding Matters*:  Real-world cloud services encode images (e.g., JPEG compression) before processing. This encoding can remove or alter carefully crafted perturbations, reducing attack success.  Prior research often neglected this, overestimating attack effectiveness.\n    *   *Image Pre-processing Awareness*: Prior attacks assume knowledge of the input shape of models in the cloud (via image resizing before the attack), but this is often not the case.\n    *   *Invalid Pixels*: Some attacks generate perturbations that create pixel values outside the valid range (0-255). Cloud services reject such images, rendering the attack ineffective.\n    *   *Cloud API Response Time*: The significantly slower response time of cloud APIs (0.5-2s per query) compared to local models with GPUs (100+ queries/second) makes online attacks much slower.\n\n2.  **Distributed Black-box Attacks:** A key trend highlighted is leveraging cloud infrastructure (load balancing) to *speed up* black-box attacks.  The authors propose two distribution frameworks:\n\n    *   *Horizontal Distribution*: Concurrently attacks *different images* within the same iteration.  This accelerates the generation of multiple adversarial examples.\n    *   *Vertical Distribution*: Sends *multiple concurrent queries for the same image* to accelerate the attack on that particular image.  Requires redesigning existing attack methods to decouple queries across iterations.\n    *   *Load Balancing Exploitation*: Thanks to load balancing, the more queries we send, the faster the queries become on average.\n\n3.  **Increased Attack Efficiency (Query Reduction):** Black-box attacks are inherently query-intensive.  A trend is to improve *query efficiency* so attacks require fewer API calls:\n\n    *   *Vertical Distribution Improves Success Rate*: The distributed Bandits attack improves the query efficiency by averaging over a batch of concurrent gradient estimations which can improve the accuracy and efficiency.\n    *   *Prior Convictions*: Using gradient priors can greatly improve query efficiency at the cost of introducing noises in the estimations.\n\n4.  **Benchmark Cloud Service for Research:** The paper addresses the lack of realistic testing environments by introducing **DeepAPI**, an open-source image classification cloud service. This enables:\n\n    *   *Testing against VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3*: Common models used in black-box attack research.\n    *   *Evaluation under different information settings*: Soft labels, hard labels, top-k predictions.\n\n**Specific Attack Methods Discussed (and modified for efficiency):**\n\nThe paper discusses and modifies three black-box attack methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of distributed attacks:\n\n*   **SimBA (Simple Black-box Attack):** A local search method.  Modified with vertical distribution to send out queries for several perturbation vectors concurrently.\n\n*   **Square Attack:** Another local search method, known for being query-efficient. Vertical distribution is applied by generating a batch of square perturbations independently and querying concurrently.\n\n*   **Bandits Attack:** A gradient estimation method. The vertically distributed Bandits attack concurrently estimates a batch of gradients for the same image.\n\n**Why This is Relevant to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\nAlthough this paper does not provide any novel defense mechanisms, it focuses on making black-box attacks more efficient and realistic. By revealing new attack methodologies, this paper highlights the importance of developing more robust defense mechanisms against these attacks.\n\n**Limitations of the Paper with Respect to the Research Question:**\n\n*   **No New Defense Mechanisms:** The paper does not propose any new defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks. It focuses solely on improving the efficiency and practicality of black-box attacks.\n*   **Limited Scope:** The paper focuses primarily on image classification models deployed as cloud APIs. It does not address other types of models or deployment scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the paper contributes to the understanding of the *threat landscape* by showing how to make black-box attacks more effective against cloud-based image classification systems. The trend is toward more realistic and efficient attacks, which creates an incentive for research into more effective defenses."

      "relevancy": "While this paper focuses on adversarial attacks for XAI evaluation in deepfake detection, it's relevant because it touches upon the broader theme of adversarial robustness and its implications for image-related tasks. It also falls within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper \"An adversarial attack approach for eXplainable AI evaluation on deepfake detection models\" with a focus on extracting information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**High-Level Summary of the Paper**\n\nThis paper does *not* directly address adversarial robustness for image classification in general. Instead, it focuses on a *specific* application: evaluating Explainable AI (XAI) tools used in *deepfake detection*.  The authors argue that generic XAI evaluation methods (like pixel removal/insertion) are not well-suited for deepfake detectors.  They propose a new evaluation approach based on adversarial attacks, where they use XAI explanations of *real* images to guide the creation of adversarial *fake* images.  The goal is to see how well different XAI tools can identify important visual concepts that, when manipulated, can fool a deepfake detector.\n\n**Why this Paper is (Mostly) Not Relevant to the Research Question**\n\n*   **Focus on XAI Evaluation, Not Adversarial Robustness:** The primary contribution is a method for *evaluating XAI tools*, not for developing or analyzing techniques to improve the adversarial robustness of image classification models. It *uses* adversarial attacks as a tool for evaluation, but doesn't focus on the attacks themselves.\n*   **Specific Domain (Deepfakes):** The techniques and analysis are tailored to deepfake detection. The paper explicitly mentions the challenges of generalizing insights from deepfake detection to other image classification tasks because of the unique nature of the visual features learned by deepfake detectors (e.g., facial artifacts).\n*   **Limited Discussion of General Adversarial Robustness Trends:**  The paper's literature review touches briefly on saliency-based adversarial attacks but only in the context of how they relate to *evaluating* XAI, not as a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in adversarial robustness techniques for broader image classification.\n\n**Specific Information that *Might* Be Considered Relevant (But Requires Careful Interpretation)**\n\nEven though the paper doesn't directly answer the research question, here's what's potentially relevant, along with caveats:\n\n*   **Saliency-Based Adversarial Attacks:** Section 2.2 (\"Saliency-based adversarial attacks\") of the paper reviews related works that confine adversarial perturbations to salient regions of an input image.\n    *   This is a *general* trend in adversarial attacks. Instead of randomly perturbing the entire image, researchers are focusing on modifying the most important regions (according to some saliency measure) to achieve successful attacks with minimal perturbation.\n    *   The paper cites several papers related to saliency-based attacks:\n        *   Dong et al. (2020): Superpixel-guided adversarial attack guided by CAM.\n        *   Xiang et al. (2021): Local black-box adversarial attack using GradCAM.\n        *   Dai et al. (2023): Saliency-based black-box attack for creating imperceptible adversarial samples.\n    *   **Caveat:**  The paper's perspective on these attacks is how they *relate* to XAI evaluation, not an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness or novel defenses against them. Also, the Xiang et al. paper from 2021 focuses on *improving query efficiency and transferability* using saliency maps, rather than robustness directly.\n*   **Black-box Attacks:** The paper uses a black-box attack strategy (NES - Natural Evolution Strategies) to generate adversarial fake images.\n    *   **Relevance:** Black-box attacks are a significant area of research in adversarial robustness because they represent a more realistic threat model (the attacker doesn't have access to the model's internals).\n    *   **Caveat:** The paper doesn't explore the *robustness* of models against black-box attacks, but rather *uses* a black-box attack to evaluate XAI tools.\n*   **Imperceptible Perturbations:** The paper emphasizes the importance of generating *visually imperceptible* adversarial examples. They use the L\u221e norm to constrain the maximum distortion of any pixel.\n    *   **Relevance:** A key trend in adversarial attack research is creating attacks that are difficult for humans to detect.\n    *   **Caveat:** Again, this is in the context of making the adversarial attack a better *evaluation* tool.\n*   **Use of XAI to Guide Attacks:** The core idea of the paper \u2013 using XAI explanations to identify regions to attack \u2013 is itself a trend.\n    *   **Relevance:**  XAI is increasingly being used not only for understanding models but also for *attacking* them.\n    *   **Caveat:**  The paper focuses on using XAI for a very specific *type* of attack (fooling deepfake detectors) and to evaluate XAI tools, not to improve general adversarial attacks.\n\n**Specific Papers Cited That Could Be Relevant (Based on Titles/Abstracts - Further Investigation Needed)**\n\n*   **Dong et al., \"Robust Superpixel-Guided Attentional Adversarial Attack,\" 2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)**:  This paper is likely relevant because it focuses on creating robust attacks by focusing perturbations on superpixels guided by attention mechanisms (CAM).  The robustness aspect is key.\n*   **Xiang, T., Liu, H., Guo, S., Zhang, T., & Liao, X, \"Local Black-box Adversarial Attacks: A Query Efficient Approach,\" 2021, arXiv:abs/2101.01032:**.

Saliency Attack: Towards Imperceptible Black-box Adversarial Attack. ACM Trans. Intell. Syst. Technol.:** This paper focuses on imperceptible black-box adversarial attacks using saliency.\n\n**In conclusion:** The paper you provided is **marginally** relevant to the research question about the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification. The techniques and analysis are not focused on improving adversarial robustness of models, but on evaluating the faithfulness of XAI tools. However, the paper's reference to the use of saliency maps and black-box methods is very helpful for gathering a more general overview of the field."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information extracted from the provided paper that addresses the research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Please note:** This paper focuses on the development of a *testing tool* (AI-COMPASS) rather than directly presenting new adversarial robustness *techniques*.  Therefore, the \"trends\" information is derived from the related works and methods *used within* the tool, reflecting what the authors consider important in the field. Also, since it is a testing tool, most of the trends discussed here are already well-established.\n\n**1. Core Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper introduces AI-COMPASS, a comprehensive and effective multi-module testing tool designed to evaluate AI systems, specifically focusing on adversarial robustness, model interpretability, and neuron analysis.  The goal is to provide a holistic assessment of deep learning models.\n\n**2. Timeframe Applicability:**\n\n*   The paper was published in 2023, thus falling within the \"last 2 years\" criterion (relative to that publication date).\n\n**3. Trends in Adversarial Robustness for Image Classification (as reflected in the AI-COMPASS tool):**\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the relevant information, categorized for clarity:\n\n*   **Emphasis on Comprehensive Testing:**\n    *   A key trend is the move away from ad-hoc, task-specific testing tools to more comprehensive frameworks that can simultaneously evaluate multiple aspects of AI systems (adversarial robustness, interpretability, neuron analysis). AI-Compass was aimed to solve the ad-hoc problem in existing testing tools.\n    *   This comprehensive approach acknowledges that robustness is not just about resisting attacks but also about understanding model behavior and potential weaknesses.\n*   **White-box vs. Black-box Attacks:**\n    *   The tool supports both white-box and black-box adversarial attack methods. This suggests that both types of attacks are considered relevant for evaluating robustness. This addresses the limitations of existing tools confined to either one of them.\n    *   *White-box attacks* (where the attacker has full knowledge of the model's architecture and parameters) are used to assess the model's *theoretical* resilience to attacks.\n    *   *Black-box attacks* (where the attacker has limited or no knowledge of the model's internals) are used to simulate more realistic real-world security threats.\n*   **Specific White-box Attack Methods Considered:**\n    *   FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) and its derivatives (I-FGSM, MI-FGSM, TI-FGSM, SINI-FGSM). These are gradient-based attacks that efficiently generate adversarial examples by perturbing the input image based on the gradient of the loss function.\n    *   PGD (Projected Gradient Descent). An iterative attack method that refines the adversarial example through multiple steps, constrained within a specified perturbation range.\n    *   C&W (Carlini & Wagner).  An optimization-based attack that focuses on crafting adversarial examples with minimal, often imperceptible, perturbations.\n    *    AdvGAN. Generates adversarial samples by learning a generator network instead of perturbing input samples directly.\n*   **Specific Black-box Attack Methods Considered:**\n    *   Query-based attacks (QEBA, ZOO): These attacks rely on querying the model with small batches of inputs to gather information about its behavior and craft adversarial examples. However, the paper also notes that these can be query-inefficient.\n    *   Transfer-based attacks (SSA, DIM, PIM, RAP, NAA):  These attacks involve training a \"surrogate\" model and then transferring the adversarial examples generated on the surrogate model to the target model. This is a practical approach when direct access to the target model is limited.\n*   **Importance of Transferability:**\n    *   The inclusion of transfer-based black-box attacks highlights the importance of *transferability* in adversarial robustness.  A robust model should not only resist attacks crafted specifically for it but also resist attacks that transfer from other models.\n*    **Metric for Robustness:** Attack Success Rate (ASR) is the fundamental metric used to evaluate the model's robustness.\n*   **Connection to Explainable AI (XAI):**\n    *   The paper emphasizes the importance of *model interpretability* alongside robustness.  Understanding *why* a model is vulnerable to attacks is crucial for developing effective defenses.\n*   **Neuron Analysis and Pruning:**\n    *   The paper explores neuron analysis, including the use of *pruning* techniques (removing redundant neurons), to understand the model's internal workings and potentially improve robustness and interpretability. Also, pruning has been proven to facilitate the interpretation of model decisions and reduce the occurrence of overfitting during adversarial sample training.\n    *   Pruning algorithms (OBD, Taylor, Greg-2, ASL) aim to remove extraneous neurons from the neural networks through neural analysis.\n*   **Model Agnostic Testing:** The tool was intended to effectively test image classification, object detection, and text classification tasks in DLS.\n\n**4. Insights from Experiments:**\n\n*   VGG-16 shows lower Attack Success Rate than ResNet-50.\n\n**In summary:** The latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, as reflected in this paper's development of the AI-COMPASS testing tool, revolve around comprehensive evaluation using both white-box and black-box attacks, with an emphasis on transferability, interpretability, and neuron analysis techniques like pruning. The research indicates that the field is moving towards holistic assessment frameworks that consider multiple facets of AI system trustworthiness, not just raw accuracy or resistance to specific attacks."

This directly relates to the research question as it explores a specific technique (attention) in the context of adversarial robustness.\n\n2.  **Attention Mechanisms and Robustness:** The paper aims to understand if learning salient features through attention mechanisms translates to better adversarial robustness. It compares attention-based models with non-attention-based models under various attacks.\n\n3.  **Datasets and Models:**\n    *   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion MNIST.\n    *   **Base Model:** ResNet-50.\n    *   **Attention Module:** Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM).

[26] use a visual attention component guided by a recurrent top down approach to improve the adversarial robustness, whereas Liu et al. [27] propose a nonlinear attention module for feature prioritization to improve adversarial robustness.\n    *   In similar work, Zhao et al. [28] show that self-attention networks may have benefits in terms of adversarial robustness and later, Vaishnavi et al. [29] use foreground attention masks i.e separate the background from the foreground and mask the background before training and classification. Their results show an increase in adversarial robustness on using foreground masks.\n    *   Goodman et al. [30] develop a method called attention and adversarial logit pairing that encourages both attention map and logit for pairs of clean examples and their adversarial counterparts to be similar.\n\n**How this Addresses the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Trend Identification:**  This paper helps identify the trend of exploring attention mechanisms for improving (or at least understanding) adversarial robustness. It confirms that attention is an area of active research.\n*   **Nuance:** The results show that simply adding attention doesn't guarantee improved robustness. The effectiveness seems highly dependent on the specific dataset.  This is a critical insight \u2013 it highlights the complexity of adversarial robustness.\n*   **Specific Techniques:**  The paper tests a specific attention module (CBAM) and provides empirical evidence of its impact on standard models like ResNet-50 under specific attacks (FGSM, PGD).\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Limited Scope:** The paper focuses on a specific type of attention module (CBAM) and a limited set of attacks.

I'll break it down into sections corresponding to the chapters in the thesis, and pay close attention to the techniques, architectures, and datasets mentioned in the context of adversarial robustness for image classification.\n\n**Overall Thesis Focus (Relevant to Research Question):**\n\n*   The thesis systematically studies the robustness of deep vision algorithms, *specifically deep classification models*, against adversarial perturbations in input data.\n*   It addresses robustness evaluation, robustness improvement, and the connection between robustness and generalization.\n\n**Chapter 1: Introduction**\n\n*   **Background**:  Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks under normal training.\n*   **Adversarial Training (AT)**:  AT-based methods (Madry et al., 2018) are a default option for enhancing the robustness of DNNs. Many variants of AT have been proposed for robustness enhancement (Cai et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2020), generalization to non-adversarial data (Zhang et al., 2019b, 2020), and computational efficiency (Shafahi et al., 2019, Wong et al., 2020). Mentions MART (Wang et al., 2020), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019a), and Free-AT (Shafahi et al., 2019).\n*   **Robust Architecture Design:**  Discusses pre-processing modules (Samangouei et al., 2018, Yang et al., 2019, Xie et al., 2018) but notes they are circumvented by adaptive attacks (Athalye et al., 2018). Mentions Guo et al. (2018) on model sparsity and Xie et al. (2019) on feature denoising.\n*   **Key Gap**: Channel-wise selection in CNNs, Neural ODEs (Chen et al., 2018), and Vision Transformers (Liu et al., 2021) are underexplored concerning robustness.\n\n**Chapter 3: On Robustness of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations**\n\n*   **Neural ODEs (NODEs) are Proposed as a Potentially More Robust Alternative to CNNs:** Explores the robustness properties of Neural ODEs (Chen et al., 2018).  Claims ODEnets (NODE-based networks) exhibit superior robustness compared to CNNs against various perturbations.\n*   **Perturbations Considered**: Random Gaussian noise, FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015), and PGD (Madry et al., 2018) adversarial examples.\n*   **Experimental Datasets**: MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), and ImgNet10 (a subset of ImageNet with 10 classes\u2014dog, bird, car, fish, monkey, turtle, lizard, bridge, cow, and crab). The ImgNet10 dataset was constructed for this thesis.\n*   **Architecture**: Compares ODEnet and CNN models, ensuring a similar number of parameters. ODEnet has a feature extractor (FE), neural ODE representation mapping (RM), and fully-connected classifier (FCC).\n*   **Training Regimes**:\n    *   Training only on original non-perturbed images.\n    *   Training on original images *and* Gaussian-perturbed images.\n*   **Findings**: ODEnets were consistently more robust than CNNs in both settings.\n*   **Proposed Solution: TisODE (Time-Invariant Steady Neural ODE)**\n    *   Addresses robustness by regularizing the flow of ODEs.\n    *   Imposes a steady-state constraint to control the change of states after time exceeds T.\n    *   Demonstrates that TisODE further boosts robustness compared to vanilla NODEs.\n    *   Claims TisODE can be combined with other robustness techniques.\n*   **Combination with Other Techniques**:  Shows TisODE can work seamlessly with Feature Denoising (FDn, Xie et al., 2019) and Input Randomization (IR, Xie et al., 2018) to enhance robustness.\n\n**Chapter 4: Improving Adversarial Robustness of CNNs via Channel-wise Importance-based Feature Selection**\n\n*   **Focus**: Addresses robustness of vanilla CNNs via a channel-wise perspective.\n*   **Key Observation**: Adversarial training (AT) robustifies CNNs by aligning channel-wise activations of adversarial data with those of natural data. However, negatively relevant (NR) channels are still over-activated by adversarial data.\n*   **Proposed Solution: CIFS (Channel-wise Importance-based Feature Selection)**\n    *   A mechanism to adjust channel activations based on their relevance to predictions.\n    *   Involves a \"probe\" network to estimate channel importance.\n    *   Generates non-negative multipliers (importance scores) based on relevances.\n    *   Adjusts channel activations in certain layers using these multipliers.\n*   **Datasets**: CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky, 2009), SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), and Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST, Xiao et al., 2017).\n*   **Architectures Used**: ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016), WideResNet-28-10.\n*   **Training Regimes**:  AT (Madry et al., 2018), FAT (Zhang et al., 2020), and TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019b). Shows CIFS can work under various AT strategies.\n*   **Evaluation Metric**:  Compares CIFS-modified CNNs with vanilla CNNs and CAS (Channel Activation Suppression, Bai et al., 2021), against various adaptive white-box attacks: FGSM, PGD-20, C&W, and PGD-100. Also uses AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020) for robustness evaluation.\n*   **Findings**: CIFS consistently enhances adversarial robustness in CNNs. Also showed that CIFS can ameliorate the overfitting issue during AT.\n\n**Key Papers and Techniques Mentioned (within the last 2 years of 2022):**\n\n*   **Data Augmentation Techniques:** Friendly Adversarial Training (FAT) (Zhang et al., 2020), AutoAugment (Cubuk et al., 2019), RandAugment (Cubuk et al., 2020)\n*   **Adversarial Training Methods:** Adversarial Training (Madry et al., 2018), TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019b), MART (Wang et al., 2020)\n*   **Architectural Modification:** RAIN (Du et al., 2020), Channel Activation Suppression (CAS) (Bai et al., 2021)\n*   **Vision Transformers** Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021)\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** AutoAttack (Croce and Hein, 2020)\n*   **Other** Zhou et al., 2020, Xie et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2021, Chen et al., 2021, Andriushchenko et al., 2020, Du et al., 2020\n\n**Summary of Trends Based on the Extracted Information:**\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training Still Dominates:** AT and its variants (FAT, TRADES, MART) are the primary focus for achieving robustness.\n2.  **Focus on Adaptive Attacks and Robust Evaluation**: Adaptive attacks (attacking models with defense mechanisms in mind) are important and robustness should be evaluated against diverse attacks (e.g., AutoAttack).\n3.  **Architectural Modifications Supplement Training:**  Instead of (or in addition to) AT, focus on modified architectures (Channel adjustments, Feature Denoising, Input Randomization) can enhance robustness.\n4.  **Exploration of Alternative Architectures:** Interest in Neural ODEs (NODEs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) as potentially more robust building blocks than CNNs.  The thesis focuses on Neural ODEs.\n5.  **Channel-wise Analysis Emerges:**  Analyzing and manipulating channels in CNNs (Channel-wise selection, Channel Activation Suppression) is a rising area of research.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points!"

      "relevancy": "This paper investigates unlearning the effects of data poisoning in machine learning models, a relevant topic to adversarial robustness. It introduces a novel approach using influence functions to identify and remove poisoned training data, contributing to the defense against adversarial attacks in image classification.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focus of the Paper:** This paper focuses on *corrective machine unlearning* in the context of data poisoning attacks. It addresses the challenge of removing the influence of poisoned training data on a trained image classification model, *after* the poisoning has occurred.  While not directly about *achieving* adversarial robustness, it deals with *mitigating* the effects of adversarial attacks that compromise model robustness.\n\n**Key Takeaways Related to Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Specifically, defense against data poisoning):**\n\n*   **Influence Functions for Detecting and Mitigating Data Poisoning:** The core trend highlighted is the *use of influence functions* to identify poisoned training data. The paper presents a novel approach, \u2206-Influence, that enhances the ability of influence functions to pinpoint problematic data points.\n\n    *   The paper notes that *naive application* of state-of-the-art influence functions *often fails* to accurately identify poisoned data in deep learning models. This is a crucial point \u2013 it acknowledges the limitations of existing methods.\n    *   \u2206-Influence addresses these shortcomings by monitoring the *changes* in influence scores when affected test points undergo transformations. This \"influence collapse\" after data transformation helps isolate poisoned data.\n    *   EK-FAC [Grosse et al., 2023] is used as a strong influence function baseline. This highlights a specific, recent advance in influence function techniques.\n    *   Multiple transformations applied to the test point (label flipping, image augmentations) act as a form of ensembling to improve detection accuracy.\n*   **Corrective Unlearning as a Response to Data Poisoning:**  The paper frames its work within the \"corrective unlearning\" paradigm. This means addressing the poisoning problem *after* the model is trained, rather than preventing it during training. This paradigm seems to be gaining traction.\n*   **Importance of Identifying a \"Critical Set\" of Poisoned Data:**  The paper argues that it's often impractical to identify and remove *all* manipulated samples.  Instead, the goal is to find a *sufficient* subset of influential poisoned data points that, when unlearned, effectively neutralize the attack.  This suggests a shift from exhaustive detection to targeted removal.\n*   **Challenges with Existing Unlearning Algorithms:** The paper notes that existing unlearning algorithms can be *ineffective*, particularly against sophisticated attacks like Witches' Brew [Geiping et al., 2021], unless the model is retrained without the *full* manipulated set. This highlights a limitation of current unlearning techniques and a need for better methods that are effective even with partial knowledge of the poisoned data.\n*   **Evaluation Against Diverse Data Poisoning Attacks:**  The paper emphasizes the need to evaluate defenses against a variety of attack types. They use BadNet [Gu et al., 2019], Witches' Brew [Geiping et al., 2021], and Smooth Trigger [Zeng et al., 2021] attacks. The observation that certain attacks (e.g., BadNet) are \"relatively easy to eliminate\" while others (e.g., frequency-based poisons) are much harder suggests that the field is moving towards more nuanced evaluations.\n*   **Unlearning Algorithms Compared:** The paper explores several unlearning algorithms including retraining from scratch (EU), Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD), SCRUB, and BadT. The results show that EU and CF perform best, and also highlights the importance of robustness towards false positives when unlearning.\n*   **Scaling to larger datasets:** Evaluation of the method on ImageNette shows consistent and robust performance of the proposed method.\n*   **Importance of minimizing false positives:** The paper found that gradient ascent-based methods like SCRUB and weight deletion methods like SSD can effectively unlearn poisoning, but can lead to significant accuracy drops if the detected set includes many falsely flagged clean examples.\n\n**Specific Papers Referenced (and their relevance):**\n\n*   **Grosse et al., 2023 (EK-FAC):** This is a state-of-the-art influence function method used as a baseline.  It shows the evolution and advancement in influence function techniques.\n*   **Gu et al., 2019 (BadNet):** A standard backdoor attack used for evaluation.\n*   **Geiping et al., 2021 (Witches' Brew):** A more sophisticated, clean-label data poisoning attack that poses a significant challenge to unlearning algorithms.\n*   **Zeng et al., 2021 (Smooth Trigger):**  Another data poisoning attack that embeds triggers in both the spatial and frequency domains, highlighting the increasing sophistication of attacks.\n*   **Goel et al., 2024:** Corrective Unlearning; several unlearning algorithms.\n*   **Foster et al., 2024:** Fast machine unlearning\n*   **Kurmanji et al., 2023:** Unbounded machine unlearning\n*   **Pawelczyk et al., 2024:** Showed that Machine unlearning fails to remove data poisoning attacks\n\n**In summary, the paper points to these trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (specifically concerning data poisoning):**\n\n1.  **Influence functions are being actively developed and refined for data poisoning detection and mitigation, with a focus on enhancing their accuracy and robustness.**\n2.  **Corrective unlearning is emerging as a practical approach to address data poisoning *after* it has occurred.**\n3.  **Research is shifting from simply detecting poisoned data to identifying a \"critical set\" whose removal effectively neutralizes the attack.**\n4.  **More sophisticated data poisoning attacks (like clean-label attacks) are challenging existing unlearning algorithms, driving the need for more robust and adaptable defenses.**\n5.  **Evaluation is becoming more nuanced, with an emphasis on testing against diverse attack types and considering the trade-off between attack mitigation and model utility (e.g., precision vs. recall in identifying poisoned data).**\n6.  **The impact of unlearning algorithm choice is significant, with EU and CF showing strong performance and robustness towards false positives.**"

      "relevancy": "This paper investigates data poisoning attacks on diffusion models, which can be relevant to adversarial robustness in image generation and classification tasks. It explores how such attacks can degrade the performance of diffusion models and discusses potential defensive advantages.",
      "summary": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided paper and extracted the information most relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overview of Relevance**\n\nThis paper primarily investigates data poisoning attacks on diffusion models (DMs), specifically focusing on a BadNets-like approach. While the main focus is on *generative models* (DMs), the authors explicitly draw connections to *image classification* and how insights from poisoned DMs can inform defenses in that domain.  The paper *does* address adversarial robustness concepts applicable to image classification. It was published in 2023, fitting the \"last 2 years\" criteria. The key angle is leveraging DMs (which are generally considered generative models) to *improve* image classification robustness against data poisoning.\n\n**Key Findings and Trends Related to Adversarial Robustness in Image Classification (extracted from the paper)**\n\nThe paper identifies the following trends, framing them as defensive \"Castle Walls\":\n\n1.  **Trigger Amplification for Data Poisoning Detection:**\n\n    *   **Observation:** BadNets-like attacks on DMs lead to \"trigger amplification,\" meaning the proportion of generated images containing the adversarial trigger is *higher* than the proportion of poisoned images in the training set.\n    *   **Application to Image Classification Robustness:**  This amplification *eases* data poisoning detection in image classification. Instead of directly analyzing the potentially enormous training dataset, one can train a DM on the dataset, generate a set of images, and then apply existing backdoor detection methods (like Cognitive Distillation (CD), STRIP, and FCT) to this *generated set*.  Because of trigger amplification, the detectors are *more effective* on the generated set than on the original training set.  The paper shows increased AUROC scores for these detection methods when applied to DM-generated images.\n    *   **Why is this relevant?** This represents a trend of using *generative models as a tool* to improve the *detectability* of poisoned data used to train image classifiers, thereby *indirectly increasing the robustness* of classifiers trained on the purified data.\n\n2.  **Using Poisoned DM-Generated Images for Robust Classifier Training:**\n\n    *   **Observation:** At *low poisoning ratios*, the poisoned DMs tend to generate images that *contain the trigger but are still correctly classified*. The authors refer to this as a \"phase transition\".\n    *   **Application to Image Classification Robustness:** The authors propose training image classifiers on *images generated from these poisoned DMs* (specifically, when the poisoning ratio is low and the \"phase transition\" effect is observed). This is suggested as a way to *mitigate* the effects of data poisoning. While the testing accuracy (TA) might slightly decrease, the *attack success rate (ASR) is significantly reduced* for classifiers trained on the generated data compared to those trained on the original poisoned training data.  The classifier trained on generated images exhibits *improved robustness* to backdoor attacks.\n    *   **Why is this relevant?**  This suggests a counter-intuitive trend: leveraging a *poisoned* generative model to *generate a more robust training set* for an image classifier. The DM acts as a data \"filter\" or \"purifier\" in this scenario.\n\n3.  **Diffusion Models as Robust Image Classifiers (Diffusion Classifiers):**\n\n    *   **Background:**  The paper mentions (and cites) recent research showing that DMs themselves can be used as image classifiers.  The classification is performed by evaluating denoising errors under different prompt conditions (image classes).\n    *   **Observation:**  The paper finds that when using a DM as an image classifier, the resulting classifier is *inherently more robust* against data poisoning attacks than a standard image classifier (like ResNet). This is evidenced by lower ASR for the DM-based classifier. Filtering out the top denoising losses of DMs can further improve the robustness of diffusion classifiers. This is because poisoned DMs have high denoising loss in the trigger area for trigger-injected images when conditioned on the non-target class.\n    *   **Why is this relevant?** This represents a trend of *re-purposing generative models* for classification tasks and discovering that these models possess *inherent robustness properties*.\n\n**Summary of Trends**\n\nThe trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, as suggested by this paper (within the last 2 years), are:\n\n*   **Generative-Model-Assisted Defense:**  Using generative models (specifically DMs) as a *tool* to improve data poisoning detection and create more robust training sets for image classifiers.  The DM is not the final classifier, but a *preprocessing step* in the training pipeline.\n*   **Intrinsic Robustness of Generative Classifiers:** Exploring the *inherent robustness properties* of generative models (DMs) when used directly as classifiers. This contrasts with traditional focus of adversarial robustness that revolves around robustness of standard architectures such as ResNet.\n\n**Important Details & Caveats:**\n\n*   **BadNets-like Attacks:**  The paper focuses specifically on BadNets-like data poisoning, where a trigger is added to images, and the corresponding labels are corrupted. Results may not generalize perfectly to all types of data poisoning attacks.\n*   **Diffusion Models Focus:** The defensive insights are derived from studying *diffusion models*. Whether these insights translate directly to other types of generative models is an open question.\n*   **Low Poisoning Ratios (for some defenses):** The \"phase transition\" effect, which enables the generation of robust training data, is most pronounced at *low poisoning ratios*. The effectiveness of this approach might diminish as the proportion of poisoned data increases.\n*   **Defense against backdoor attacks:** This paper specifically focuses on defending against *backdoor attacks* launched by data poisoning. It does not address other types of adversarial attacks such as adversarial examples.\n\n**Why this paper is relevant to the Research Question.**\n\nThis paper brings a fresh perspective to adversarial robustness in image classification by looking at it through the lens of generative models. The core idea is that by understanding how diffusion models react to data poisoning, we can extract defensive strategies that improve the robustness of image classifiers. The paper makes concrete proposals for how to leverage DMs for data poisoning detection and robust classifier training."

      "relevancy": "This paper focuses on quantifying the robustness of deep multispectral segmentation models against natural perturbations and data poisoning, a form of adversarial attack. The work is relevant as it assesses the impact of adversarial attacks on image segmentation models, which are closely related to image classification.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's extract the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper primarily investigates the adversarial and natural robustness of deep learning models for *multispectral image segmentation*, NOT image classification directly.  It focuses on overhead (satellite) imagery and examines how different input data (RGB, NIR, RGB+NIR) and fusion architectures (early vs. late fusion) impact model robustness against data poisoning attacks and natural perturbations (fog and snow).\n\n**Key Findings Related to Adversarial Robustness (Data Poisoning):**\n\n*   **Vulnerability to Data Poisoning:**  The study finds that all tested segmentation models (NIR, RGB, RGB+NIR, early fusion, late fusion) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks.  This is a significant finding, indicating a general weakness in these models.\n*   **High Adversarial Success Rate (ASR):** Data poisoning attacks, both fine-grained and physically realizable, achieved a high ASR (>90%) even with only 10% of the training data being poisoned. This underscores the effectiveness of data poisoning.\n*   **Fusion Architecture Invariance:** Contrary to some prior work (e.g., [23]), the paper did *not* find significant differences in adversarial robustness between early and late fusion architectures.  This suggests the choice of fusion architecture doesn't automatically confer greater robustness against data poisoning in image *segmentation*, even though it might in other tasks like object detection.\n*   **Best Performing Models Less Robust:** Models with the best \"clean\" performance (RGB+NIR) tended to exhibit *worse* adversarial robustness.  The added information improved accuracy on clean data but increased susceptibility to attacks.\n*   **Stealthiness of Attacks:** Physically realizable \"texture attacks\" are more stealthy than fine-grained attacks. Texture attacks have similar benign and clean scores, and attacked scores do not show as sharp a decrease in performance as fine-grained attacks.\n*   **Attack Types Studied:**  The paper explores two main types of data poisoning attacks:\n    *   **Fine-grained attacks:** Inserting a small trigger (line or square) into training images and associating the trigger with a misclassification (e.g., foliage being classified as building).\n    *   **Texture attacks:** Replacing pixels of a source class with a random texture from a different class. The aim is to create an exploitable representation that can be triggered during evaluation.\n\n**Key Findings Related to Natural Robustness (Perturbations):**\n\n*   **Physically Realistic Perturbations Matter:**  The paper highlights the importance of creating physically realistic perturbations for multispectral data.  Naive application of RGB-based perturbations to NIR channels can lead to unrealistic scenarios and inaccurate robustness assessments.\n*   **Improved Robustness with Fused Models:** Both RGB+NIR models show improved robustness to natural perturbations over RGB-only models, suggesting they can leverage NIR information to improve performance in adverse weather.\n*   **Early Fusion Models Show Greatest Natural Robustness:** Early fusion models have the best overall natural robustness, which aligns with results from [38] that find that the early fusion models rely more on NIR inputs.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions (Relevant to the Research Question):**\n\n*   **Limited Attack Surface:** The paper focuses primarily on data poisoning. It doesn't explore other adversarial attack strategies like adversarial examples generated at test time (e.g., FGSM, PGD).\n*   **Limited Modalities:** This paper focuses on RGB and NIR imagery. Exploring other modalities in conjunction with these would provide a more comprehensive view of the performance landscape.\n*   **Future Work:** The authors suggest extending adversarial and natural perturbations to models with additional input bands to determine if more channels lead to more or less vulnerable models. They also propose isolating test splits to probe sub-optimal environmental conditions and extend the research to include LiDAR observations.\n\n**How this paper informs latest trends (given the two-year constraint):**\n\nWhile this paper itself provides valuable insights, it is important to note how it relates to the bigger picture of adversarial robustness. Specifically, the paper explores the intersection of:\n\n1.  **Multispectral Imagery and Remote Sensing:** The paper extends research on adversarial robustness to the less-explored domain of multispectral imagery, relevant in remote sensing applications.\n2.  **Data Poisoning:** By focusing on data poisoning, the research addresses a more practical and potentially insidious threat compared to some other attack types.\n3.  **Physically Realistic Attacks:** It highlights the importance of considering the physical characteristics of different spectral bands when creating adversarial attacks and natural perturbations, especially when dealing with multispectral data.\n4.  **Early and Late Fusion Techniques:** This compares common methods to combine multiple data sources to see if one is more vulnerable than the other.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThis paper does NOT investigate image *classification*. The findings suggest that, at least in the domain of *multispectral image segmentation*, data poisoning remains a significant threat, and models that simply perform better on clean data are not necessarily more robust to adversarial attacks. The choice of fusion architecture doesn't guarantee robustness. Future work is needed to explore a broader range of attack types and modalities to better understand the adversarial landscape for multispectral imagery. The overall trend is toward more practical and physically grounded threat models."

This is a departure from solely relying on algorithmic defenses.\n\n    *   The paper experimentally validates the claim that AIMC chips based on PCM devices demonstrate higher adversarial robustness when performing image classification using a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on CIFAR-10.\n    *   This suggests a shift towards exploring hardware-level defenses against adversarial attacks.\n\n2.  **Role of Stochasticity (Noise):** The paper identifies that the stochastic nature of AIMC, specifically the various noise sources within the chip, is a key factor contributing to adversarial robustness.\n\n    *   **Stochastic Noise Sources:** The inherent non-deterministic compute substrates, specifically both recurrent and non-recurrent stochastic noise sources, are responsible for the adversarial robustness.\n    *   **Types of Noise:**\n        *   **Non-recurrent noise:** Arises from programming inaccuracies when setting analog conductance values in PCM devices (programming noise).\n        *   **Recurrent noise:**  Comes from 1/f noise and Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) characteristic of PCM devices, as well as output noise at the crossbar output.\n    *   **Impact of Noise Properties:**\n        *   The type and magnitude properties of stochastic noise sources have the greatest influence on adversarial robustness.\n        *   The location (weight vs output noise) and recurrence properties have negligible influence.\n        *   Output noise exhibits greater adversarial robustness compared to weight noise, as the effect of weight noise is input dependent, whereas output noise is not.\n\n3.  **Hardware-Aware Training (HWA):** While not a new trend, the paper confirms that HWA training enhances adversarial robustness in the context of AIMC.\n\n    *   HWA training involves injecting noise during the training process to make the DNN more robust to hardware imperfections.\n    *   The study found that HWA-trained networks deployed on the AIMC chip exhibit notably improved adversarial robustness.\n\n4.  **Hardware-in-the-Loop Attacks:** The paper explores a more realistic attack scenario where the attacker has full access to the hardware.\n\n    *   Even in hardware-in-the-loop attacks, the AIMC chip demonstrates greater resilience compared to deterministic systems like digital hardware accelerators.\n    *   Hardware-in-the-loop attacks are more difficult to perform on stochastic hardware because the construction of representative hardware models is non-trivial.\n\n5.  **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper uses the Adversarial Success Rate (ASR) metric to evaluate the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. The ASR metric focuses on samples correctly classified by the network without adversarial attacks.\n\n6.  **Attacks Considered:** Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Square, and OnePixel attacks were used to evaluate adversarial robustness.\n\n7.  **Transferability to NLP:** While primarily focused on image classification, the paper provides simulation evidence suggesting that the adversarial robustness of AIMC extends to transformer networks used for NLP tasks, specifically the RoBERTa model.\n\n**Specific Experiments & Results for Image Classification:**\n\n*   **Target Platforms:** The study compares adversarial robustness across:\n    *   Original floating-point model (Original Network (FP32))\n    *   Floating-point HWA retrained model (HWA Retrained (FP32))\n    *   Digital hardware accelerator with 4-bit fixed-point weight precision and 8-bit activation precision (Digital)\n    *   PCM-based AIMC chip model (AIMC Chip Model)\n    *   PCM-based AIMC chip (AIMC Chip)\n\n*   **Key Result:** Hardware experiments on the AIMC chip result in the highest level of robustness to all investigated adversarial attacks, showing good agreement with the AIMC chip model.\n\n**Implications & Future Directions:**\n\n*   The paper suggests that the inherent stochasticity of AIMC chips can be leveraged as a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks without incurring additional hardware costs or requiring modifications to training/deployment pipelines.\n*   Future AIMC designs could intentionally incorporate specific types of noise sources to further enhance adversarial robustness.\n*   The research highlights the need to explore hardware-level defenses in addition to algorithmic approaches.\n*   The methodology developed can be extended to evaluate adversarial robustness against other attack types, other types of AIMC hardware, and chips with different underlying architectures.\n*   Future work includes the investigation of different attack types, e.g., poisoning-based attacks, and physical-based attacks, e.g., those which maliciously introduce instability to the system.\n\n**References to Prior Work (within the last 2 years):**\n\nThe following references appear to be from 2022-2024, and thus within the specified timeframe:\n\n*   Reference \\[3]:  N.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of information from the provided paper relevant to the research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper investigates the connection between causal disentanglement in neural networks and their adversarial robustness.  It doesn't directly introduce *new* adversarial robustness techniques, but rather it *analyzes* how *existing* causal models perform against adversarial attacks and tries to quantify *why* they might be more robust.\n\n**Relevant Information (Last 2 Years Focus):**\n\nSince the paper itself was written in the last 2 years and cites papers from that time, it provides a snapshot of relevant trends, even if its primary contribution is analytical.\n\n1.  **Causal Neural Networks (Causal NNs) for Adversarial Robustness (Trend):**\n\n    *   The paper highlights a growing trend of using Causal Neural Networks (Causal NNs) to improve adversarial robustness. Causal NNs explicitly aim to separate causally linked information from spurious correlations in the input data. The cited paper, [Ren et al. 2022a], is an example of improving adversarial robustness with Causal NNs.\n    *   The central idea is that adversarial attacks exploit spurious correlations learned by traditional neural networks. Causal NNs, by focusing on causal relationships, are theorized to be less susceptible to these attacks [Sch\u00a8olkopf et al. 2021].\n    *   The paper investigates four specific Causal NN models published between 2020 and 2022. This indicates active research in this specific area.\n    *   Cited [Zhao et al. 2022] - Natural Language Processing model uses latent-space smoothing over the confounder signal in a similar manner to CausalAdv to increase adversarial robustness.\n\n2.  **Focus on Disentangled Representations (Trend):**\n\n    *   The core concept behind using causal models for robustness is *disentangled representations*. These representations separate different semantic concepts into distinct components of the model's internal representations.\n    *   *Causal disentanglement* specifically aims to separate input features that are causally related to the output label from features that are spuriously correlated.\n    *   The paper attempts to *quantify* the level of causal disentanglement and relate it to adversarial robustness. This focus on quantitative analysis of disentanglement is itself a trend.\n    *   It builds on previous work in disentanglement, but addresses the limitations of existing metrics when applied to deterministic models trained on real-world datasets. The metrics it uses are Distance Correlation (DC) and Information over Bias (IoB).\n\n3.  **Adversarial Training (Technique within the Trend):**\n\n    *   Adversarial training, where models are trained on both clean and adversarially perturbed examples, is a common technique used within the broader trend of Causal NNs for robustness.\n    *   The CausalAdv and DICE models explicitly employ adversarial training. [Ren et al. 2022b] also uses adversarial training, but is different from the studied model type.\n    *   The DICE model specifically uses a \"domain-attack invariant causal learning\" approach, which aims to learn representations that are invariant to both domain shifts and adversarial attacks.\n\n4.  **White-Box Attacks as Evaluation Standard (Evaluation Trend):**\n\n    *   The paper uses white-box attacks (PGD, CW, FGSM) to evaluate the robustness of the models. This indicates that white-box attacks are considered a strong evaluation standard in the field.  White-box attacks assume the attacker has full knowledge of the model's architecture, weights, and gradients.\n    *   The paper mentions the hypothesis in the field of Causal NNs that adversarial attacks exploit learnt spurious correlations between s and y [Sch\u00a8olkopf et al. 2021].\n\n5.  **Specific Models (Examples of the Trend):**\n\n    *   The paper investigates these four models from 2020-2022 (representative of research from the last 2 years):\n        *   **CAMA:** Deep causal manipulation augmented model [Zhang et al. 2020b]. Based on a VAE and uses shifted images as perturbed data during training.\n        *   **CaaM:** Causal attention module [Wang et al. 2021].  Uses a CBAM attention mechanism to separate causal and confounder features.\n        *   **CausalAdv:** Causal-inspired adversarial distribution alignment method [Zhang et al. 2021]. Aligns the distributions of natural and adversarial data.\n        *   **DICE:** Domain-attack invariant causal learning model [Ren et al. 2022b].  Uses input masking to separate causal and confounder signals, and employs a replay buffer to approximate backdoor adjustment.\n\n**Summary of Trends Gleaned from the Paper (Last 2 Years):**\n\n*   **Causal Neural Networks for Robustness:** A significant trend involves using Causal NNs to learn representations resistant to adversarial attacks by modeling causal rather than just statistical relationships.\n*   **Disentanglement as a Key Principle:** Disentangled representations, especially *causal disentanglement*, are considered crucial for achieving robustness.\n*   **Adversarial Training Remains Important:** Adversarial training is still a core technique, often integrated into Causal NN architectures to improve robustness.\n*   **White-Box Attacks for Rigorous Evaluation:** White-box attacks are considered a stringent evaluation standard for measuring adversarial robustness.\n*   **Quantifying Disentanglement:** There's a growing interest in *quantitatively* measuring the level of disentanglement achieved by different models, to better understand its impact on robustness.\n\n**Important Note:** This paper doesn't introduce *new* adversarial defense techniques itself. Instead, it *analyzes* the robustness of existing *causal* models. So, the trends extracted here are more about the *approach* to building robust models, rather than specific *defense mechanisms*."

It is within the 2 year timeframe.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to the research question, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification from the last 2 years (approximately 2022-2024, given the paper's context):\n\n**General Trends & Challenges Addressed:**\n\n*   **Bridging the Gap:** The paper identifies a gap in adversarial robustness research, specifically the lack of focus on video understanding tasks. Most adversarial robustness techniques are developed for *image classification*, and their direct application to videos is not fully explored. The paper bridges the gap by adapting and extending such techniques for video. While the paper focuses on video, it references image classification techniques and their impact.\n*   **Vulnerability of Deep Learning:** The paper reiterates the established vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial examples, even with imperceptible input changes, impacting their generalizability. This is a continuing concern across both image and video domains.\n*   **Challenges in Video:**  The paper emphasizes challenges unique to video:\n    *   Increased input size (temporal dimension) increases model capacity and vulnerability.\n    *   The number of possible tags/classes increases due to variations in sequences.\n\n**Techniques and Approaches (with relevance to image classification, even if indirectly):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** The paper uses and builds upon the concept of *adversarial training*, a key technique in image classification. Adversarial training involves creating adversarial examples (perturbed inputs designed to fool the model) during training.\n    *   The model is then trained to correctly classify these adversarial examples, making it more robust.\n    *   The paper cites \\[11, 14] as examples of adversarial training in images. Specifically, \\[14] (Miyato et al., 2018 - while slightly outside the strict 2-year window, still relevant) proposes computing adversarial counterparts of images during training and adding a loss regularization to ensure correct classification or predictions close to the original image.\n*   **Loss Regularization:** The paper explores different loss regularization techniques to improve robustness.  The core idea is to add terms to the loss function that penalize the model for making incorrect predictions on adversarial examples or for having drastically different internal representations (e.g., attention maps) for original and adversarial inputs.\n    *   `Lout,Adv`: Adversarial loss in the output space, minimizing the loss for adversarial counterparts of training samples. This is a direct extension of image-based adversarial loss to videos.  It aims to make the model's *output* robust.\n    *   `L(out,att),Adv`:  Combines output space adversarial loss with *attention-map regularization*. This is the key novel contribution. It aims to make the *attention mechanism* itself robust.\n*   **Attention-Map Regularization:** This is a core innovation aimed at improving robustness of Transformer models:\n    *   The idea is that the attention maps (which indicate which parts of the input the model is focusing on) *should* be similar for original and adversarial examples.\n    *   A regularization term is added to minimize the difference (Frobenius norm) between attention maps generated for the original input and its adversarial counterpart.  This encourages the model to attend to the same features even when the input is perturbed.\n*   **FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method):** The paper employs a method closely related to FGSM for generating adversarial perturbations (equation 4). FGSM is a popular and efficient technique in image classification for creating adversarial examples by taking a step in the direction of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input.\n*   **DeepFool:** The paper also evaluates the robustness of its models against adversarial perturbations generated using the DeepFool method \\[12], another technique commonly used in image classification. DeepFool aims to find the *smallest* perturbation needed to change the model's prediction.\n*   **Transformers:** The paper uses the Transformer architecture, which has become increasingly popular in image classification in recent years (as referenced by \\[2], \"An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale,\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11929, 2020.\"). The paper explores how to make Transformers more robust.\n\n**Key Findings & Contributions:**\n\n*   **Attention-Map Regularization is Key:** The most important finding is that *attention-map regularization* (`L(out,att),Adv`) significantly improves adversarial robustness of Transformer-based video classification models. The proposed A-ART model, which incorporates this regularization, outperforms simpler extensions of image-based adversarial training (ART).\n*   **Improved Robustness:** A-ART achieves closer to non-adversarial performance on adversarial examples.  It shows substantial gains in GAP (Global Average Precision) on adversarial test sets compared to the baseline Transformer and ART.\n*   **Smoother Attention Maps:** A-ART generates smoother attention maps, enforcing temporal coherence, which helps video classification.\n*   **Reduced MSE in Attention Maps:** A-ART drastically reduces the mean square error (MSE) between attention maps of original and adversarial videos, demonstrating that it learns to be less fooled by perturbations.\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning Matters:** The paper highlights the importance of tuning hyperparameters like \u03f5 (perturbation radius) and \u03b1 (adversarial loss weight) for optimal performance.\n*   **Enhanced Robustness (DeepFool):** A-ART exhibits improved robustness to adversarial perturbations generated using the DeepFool method.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work**\n\n*   The paper focuses on video and feature-based attacks\n*   Future work includes investigating the robustness of intermediate embeddings and extending A-ART to raw video datasets for more realistic evaluation.\n\n**In summary:** This paper contributes to the trend of improving adversarial robustness by focusing on the attention mechanisms within Transformer models. It borrows and extends adversarial training and perturbation generation techniques (FGSM, DeepFool) that are widely used in image classification, but adapts them to the video domain and, crucially, adds attention-map regularization to achieve better robustness. The findings suggest that making the *internal representations* (attention maps) of models more robust is a promising direction for future research."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the paper, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, especially concerning developments within the last 2 years.\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper introduces a novel method called \"Adversarially Robust Feature Learning\" (ARFL) to improve the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks, specifically in the context of breast cancer diagnosis using mammogram images.  ARFL aims to learn features that are robust to both standard and adversarial data by incorporating a feature correlation measure into the training process. The work focuses on image classification.\n\n**Key Findings & Contributions:**\n\n*   **ARFL Method:** The core contribution is the ARFL regularization method, which encourages the learning of robust features (high correlation with ground truth labels) and discourages spurious features (low correlation) when training with a mix of standard and adversarial data. It uses a \"robust loss\" (Lrobust) function that measures feature-label correlation.\n*   **Performance Improvement:** ARFL, when integrated into adversarial training, demonstrates improved performance on both standard and adversarial data compared to several state-of-the-art methods. This includes:\n    *   Domain-Specific Batch Normalization (DSBN)\n    *   TRADES (a method that trades off between robustness and accuracy)\n    *   Multi-Instance Robust Self-Training (MIRST)\n*   **Optimal Mixing Ratio:** The paper investigates the optimal ratio of mixing standard and adversarial data during training.  The results suggest that while a 1:1 ratio (dual adversarial training) is often used, the optimal ratio may vary depending on the dataset. In the CMMD dataset, the highest performance was achieved at r = 0.75, which means that 75% of the data was standard data.\n*   **Medical Imaging Application:** The method is successfully applied to real-world mammogram datasets for breast cancer diagnosis, indicating its potential in medical applications. The method enhances the learning of discriminative imaging features for diagnosis.\n\n**Adversarial Training and Defense Techniques Discussed (Relevant to the last 2 years):**\n\nThe paper explicitly mentions and compares against several techniques relevant to adversarial robustness in image classification, particularly those developed or significantly discussed within the past 2 years:\n\n*   **Dual Adversarial Training (Joel et al., 2022):** ARFL is evaluated in conjunction with dual adversarial training, where the model is trained using both standard and adversarial data. The paper shows ARFL improves dual adversarial training.\n*   **Multi-Instance Robust Self-Training (MIRST) (Sun et al., 2022):** MIRST is used as a comparison baseline. It uses different levels of perturbations to generate adversarial examples as additional data for self-training. The authors show that ARFL can learn robust features without using multiple instances, like MIRST does.\n*   **TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019):** TRADES is another comparison method. This is an adversarial defense method that balances model performance on adversarial data and standard data using KL-divergence for regularization.\n*   **Domain-Specific Batch Normalization (DSBN) (Chang et al., 2019):** DSBN is a domain adaptation technique that allocates domain-specific affine parameters for data from different domains.\n*   **PGD and FGSM Attacks (Madry et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2014):**  These are the methods used to generate adversarial examples for training and evaluation. The paper uses PGD in breast cancer diagnosis and FGSM for synthetic experiment.\n\n**Trends Indicated by the Paper and Related Work:**\n\nBased on the techniques discussed and the results presented, the paper highlights the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification:\n\n1.  **Importance of Feature Learning:** A key focus is on learning robust features that are correlated with true labels and resistant to adversarial perturbations.  This shifts the emphasis from simply minimizing classification loss to explicitly shaping the feature space.\n2.  **Balancing Robustness and Accuracy:** The trade-off between robustness (performance on adversarial data) and standard accuracy (performance on clean data) remains a central challenge.  Methods like TRADES and ARFL aim to find a better balance. The authors emphasize that the goal is to have models perform stably on both standard data and adversarial data.\n3.  **Adversarial Training Remains a Core Technique:** Adversarial training, where models are trained with adversarially perturbed data, is still a primary method for improving robustness. However, the effectiveness of adversarial training is highly dependent on factors such as the mixing ratio of standard and adversarial data, the perturbation budget, and the specific architecture.\n4.  **Self-Training and Unlabeled Data:** Methods like robust self-training (RST) and MIRST leverage unlabeled data or multiple instances to improve robustness. However, the paper points out that these methods may be challenging when data is limited.\n5.  **Medical Imaging Specifics:** Adversarial robustness in medical imaging presents unique challenges due to the subtle and heterogeneous nature of medical images.  Attacks can have serious consequences in clinical settings, making robust models essential.\n6. **Importance of Parameter Selection:** This paper investigates optimal parameters for adversarial training such as the mixing ratio of standard and adversarial data and perturbation budget.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that the optimal mixing ratio of standard and adversarial data can vary across datasets and tasks, suggesting the need for adaptive or task-specific strategies.\n*   Future work involves extending the evaluation of ARFL against other types of adversarial attacks.\n*   The datasets used, while real-world, are specific to breast cancer diagnosis. Further research could explore the generalizability of ARFL to other medical imaging tasks and modalities.\n\nIn summary, this paper contributes to the ongoing research on adversarial robustness by introducing ARFL, a feature learning-based regularization method, and demonstrating its effectiveness in the context of breast cancer diagnosis.  It also underscores the importance of balancing robustness and accuracy, the continued relevance of adversarial training, and the unique challenges of adversarial defense in medical imaging. The comparison against other methods shows how ARFL improves over state-of-the-art techniques for adversarial robustness for image classification in the last 2 years."

The paper analyzes how neural networks can retain their ability to adapt to low-dimensional structures in data even when trained to be robust against adversarial perturbations. This is a significant trend because simply applying adversarial training naively can degrade standard performance.\n\n**Key Information and Trends Gleaned from the Paper (Focus on 2023-2024)**\n\nThe paper itself was published in 2024. The information about trends comes from its literature review, related works section, and discussions:\n\n1.  **Feature Learning and Low-Dimensional Structures:**\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes a recent focus on feature learning in neural networks, specifically related to learning single- and multi-index models. The underlying assumption is that data often has a low-dimensional structure, and efficient learning involves recovering this structure. Relevant cited works include:\n        *   `[WLLM19]` (likely before the 2-year window, but foundational)\n        *   `[DLS22]`\n        *   `[BBSS22]`\n        *   `[BEG+22]`\n        *   `[BES+22]`\n        *   `[MHPG+23]`\n        *   `[AAM22]`\n        *   `[ABAM23]`\n        *   `[DKL+23]`\n\n    *   These works suggest a trend towards understanding *how* neural networks learn useful features and avoid the curse of dimensionality by adapting to low-dimensional structures.\n\n2.  **Challenges in Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n    *   The paper acknowledges the observed susceptibility of standard neural networks to adversarial attacks.\n    *   It points out a key challenge: Adversarial training (e.g., `[MMS+18]`), while designed to improve robustness, often degrades standard performance (`[TSE+18]`). This leads to the question of how to maintain adaptability to problem structure *while* ensuring robustness.\n\n3.  **Robustness and Low-Dimensional Structures (Central Theme):**\n\n    *   The core argument is that neural networks *can* retain statistical adaptivity to low-dimensional structures when trained for robustness.\n    *   Specifically, the paper shows (theoretically) that for multi-index models with \u21132-constrained perturbations, the optimal low-dimensional representations for robust learning are the same as those for standard learning.\n    *   This indicates a trend towards exploring how *problem structure* can be leveraged to improve robust generalization in neural networks. This is an alternative to brute-force adversarial training.\n\n4.  **Specific Papers Related to Feature Learning for Single/Multi-Index Models (2023-2024):**\n\n    *   **Focus on Information and Generative Exponents:** Several recent papers (within the last 2 years) are mentioned that analyze the sample complexity of learning single-index models in terms of \"information exponents\" or \"generative exponents\". This suggests a trend towards more fine-grained analysis of the *statistical* complexity of feature learning. Examples include:\n        *   `[MHPG+23]`\n        *   `[MLHD23]`\n        *   `[DNGL23]`\n        *   `[BES+23]`\n        *   `[DPVLB24]` - This paper characterizes the computational complexity of learning gaussian single-index models.\n        *   `[ADK+24]` - Explores the benefits of data repetition for gradient descent.\n        *   `[LOSW24]` - Focuses on neural networks learning low-dimensional polynomials near the information-theoretic limit with SGD\n        *   `[JMS24]` - Discusses the complexity of learning sparse functions with statistical and gradient queries.\n\n    *   **Mean-Field Analysis:** A line of research focuses on the mean-field or wide limits of two-layer neural networks to provide learnability guarantees, especially when considering the mean-field interaction between neurons (`[CB18, RVE18, MMN18, WLLM19, CB20, AAM22, Tel23, MZD+23, CG24]`). Examples include:\n        *   `[MHWE24]` - Discusses learning multi-index models with neural networks via mean-field langevin dynamics.\n        *   `[NOSW24]` - Studies the improved statistical and computational complexity of mean-field langevin dynamics under structured data.\n        *   `[WMHC24]` - Explores mean-field langevin dynamics for signed measures via a bilevel approach.\n\n5.  **Adversarially Robust Learning (Specific Papers, particularly focusing on mitigating tradeoffs):**\n\n    *   The paper contrasts its approach with works focusing on *tradeoffs* between robustness and accuracy (e.g., `[JSH20]`, `[JS22]`, `[HJ24]`).\n    *   **Mitigating the Tradeoff via Low-Dimensional Structures:** Critically, the paper mentions `[JM24]` which shows that the robustness-accuracy tradeoff is *mitigated* when the data enjoys a low-dimensional structure. However, `[JM24]` focuses on binary classification with features on a known low-dimensional manifold and considers infinite samples. The current paper aims to provide convergence rates for adversarial risk under feature learning with *finite* samples. The paper aims to provide convergence rates for adversarial risk under feature learning with *finite* samples.\n    *   `[LL24]` - Theoretical analysis of feature learning process under structured data and adversarial training improvements.\n\n**Synthesis and Implications for Image Classification Trends**\n\nWhile the paper is not directly about image classification methods, it has implications:\n\n*   **Moving Beyond Brute-Force Adversarial Training:** The dominant trend of simply applying adversarial training to large image classification models might be reaching its limits (due to the observed degradation in standard performance).  The paper's analysis (and the cited works) suggest a trend towards understanding *why* adversarial training works (or doesn't work) and how to leverage problem structure to improve robust generalization.\n*   **Importance of Feature Learning and Representation:** The paper reinforces the importance of feature learning. Adversarial robustness isn't just about the final classifier; it's about learning robust *representations*. The ability of neural networks to adapt to low-dimensional structures (e.g., learning disentangled features) might be crucial for achieving both robustness and good standard performance.\n*   **Theoretical Foundations for Robustness:**  The emphasis on information exponents, generative exponents, and mean-field analysis indicates a trend towards developing a more solid theoretical foundation for understanding adversarial robustness. This is essential for designing more principled and effective robust training methods. The development of new algorithms for feature learning using gradient-based methods is also a trend.\n*   **Exploiting Data Structure:** A critical trend highlighted is the recognition that exploiting the intrinsic structure of data (e.g., low-dimensionality, manifold structure) is key to achieving better robustness *without* sacrificing accuracy. This means moving away from generic robustness techniques and towards methods that are tailored to the specific characteristics of the data.\n\n**In conclusion:** The trend for adversarial robustness in image classification is moving from brute-force methods to more nuanced approaches. The paper and its cited works suggest a focus on understanding the interplay between feature learning, low-dimensional structures, and robustness, with an emphasis on developing theoretical foundations and exploiting data structure to mitigate the robustness-accuracy tradeoff."

It is relevant to the research question because it explores data augmentation techniques that can improve the adversarial robustness of image classification models.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided paper, focusing on information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Relevance:**\n\nThis paper primarily focuses on data augmentation techniques using diffusion models to improve image classification performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data (few-shot, long-tail). It **does not directly address adversarial robustness**.  While data augmentation can *indirectly* contribute to robustness, that isn't the main focus here. Therefore, direct relevance to the research question is low.\n\n**Key Findings & Insights (with potential *indirect* connections to robustness):**\n\n*   **Problem Addressed:** The paper identifies that existing generative data augmentation methods for image classification often struggle to balance \"faithfulness\" (accurate representation of the foreground object) and \"diversity\" (varied background contexts).\n\n*   **Proposed Solution: Diff-Mix:**  Diff-Mix is a novel inter-class data augmentation method using diffusion models. It performs image translations between classes, aiming to create synthetic images that retain the original background context while modifying the foreground to match a target concept.\n\n*   **Methodology:**\n    *   **Personalized Fine-tuning:** Fine-tunes a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) to generate faithful foreground concepts. They use a combination of Dreambooth (DB) and Textual Inversion (TI) for this.  TI helps with semantic understanding, while DB refines the personalized generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.\n    *   **Inter-Class Image Translation:** Transforms a reference image into an edited version that incorporates prompts from different classes. This is achieved using a technique inspired by SDEdit, controlling the strength of the translation to balance diversity and faithfulness. The synthetic image is labeled with a weighted combination of the original and target class labels (Eq. 3).\n    *   **Data Cleaning:** Employs CLIP to filter out unrealistic synthetic images with incomplete foregrounds.\n\n*   **Experimental Results & Claims:**\n\n    *   **Few-Shot Classification:** Diff-Mix outperforms intra-class augmentation and distillation-based methods in few-shot scenarios.\n    *   **Conventional Classification:** Diff-Mix shows stable improvements across various domain-specific datasets. Combining Diff-Mix with CutMix often yields better performance.\n    *   **Long-Tail Classification:** Diff-Mix performs well in long-tail classification tasks, especially in the low-shot regime.\n    *   **Background Robustness (Indirectly Related):** Evaluated using the Waterbird dataset (CUB foregrounds pasted onto Places backgrounds). Diff-Mix demonstrates improved robustness to background shifts compared to other methods, particularly in counterfactual scenarios (e.g., waterbirds on land).  This suggests Diff-Mix helps the model focus on foreground features rather than spurious correlations with the background.\n    *   **Size and Diversity:** Performance increases with the size and diversity of the synthetic data. More diverse backgrounds (more referable classes) lead to better performance.\n    *   **Fine-tuning Strategy:** TI+DB (Textual Inversion + Dreambooth) is the preferred fine-tuning strategy.\n\n**Why it *Indirectly* Relates to Adversarial Robustness (and why it's still *mostly* irrelevant):**\n\n*   **Data Augmentation as Regularization:**  Data augmentation, in general, can act as a form of regularization. By exposing the model to a wider range of data distributions (including variations in background, pose, etc.), it can become less sensitive to specific features and potentially more robust to adversarial examples.\n*   **Background Disentanglement:** Diff-Mix's ability to disentangle foreground and background might make the model less susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit background correlations. If an attacker relies on manipulating the background to fool the classifier, a model trained with Diff-Mix might be less vulnerable.\n*   **Emphasis on Foreground Features:** By forcing the model to focus on foreground object characteristics, Diff-Mix could make it harder for an adversary to craft subtle perturbations that fool the classifier without significantly altering the object's appearance.\n\n**Why it's *Mostly* Irrelevant**\n\n*   **No Direct Evaluation of Adversarial Attacks:**  The paper doesn't explicitly test or evaluate the model's performance against any standard adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, CW).\n*   **Focus on Natural Data Distribution Shifts:** The primary concern is improving generalization to different data distributions, not robustness to specifically crafted adversarial perturbations. The \"background robustness\" experiments address *natural* variations in the background, not adversarial manipulations.\n*   **No Mention of Adversarial Training:** The paper doesn't explore adversarial training, which is the most common and effective technique for improving adversarial robustness.\n\n**Specific Information to note from the Abstract and Introduction:**\n\n*   The abstract mentions improving performance across diverse image classification scenarios including few-shot, conventional, and long-tail classifications for domain-specific datasets.\n*   The introduction discusses the challenge of generating samples with both a faithful foreground and a diverse background.\n*   The introduction mentions Mixup and CutMix as non-generative data augmentation techniques, but notes their inability to produce realistic images.\n*   The introduction presents the research question: \"Is it feasible to develop a method that optimizes both the diversity and faithfulness of synthesized data simultaneously?\"\n\n**Specific Information to note from the Related Works:**\n\n*   The related works section mentions that some works find that learning from synthetic data presents transferability and robustness but this relates to distribution shift and not necessarily adversarial robustness.\n*   The related works mentions that the use of StyleGAN for generating interpolated images between two different domains has been shown to enhance classifier robustness for out-of-distribution data, but this is not the main topic of the paper.\n\n**Specific Information to note from the Method Section:**\n\n*   The method introduces Diff-Mix, which leverages fine-tuned diffusion models for inter-class image interpolation.\n*   The method discusses Dreambooth and Textual Inversion as techniques for personalizing text-to-image diffusion models.\n*   The method discusses SDEdit as inspiration for performing edits on the reference image.\n\n**Specific Information to note from the Experiment Section:**\n\n*   The experiment section evaluates Diff-Mix on few-shot, conventional, and long-tail classification tasks.\n*   The experiment section evaluates Diff-Mix's robustness to background shifts using the Waterbird dataset.\n*   The experiment section discusses the impact of size and diversity on synthetic data.\n*   The experiment section discusses the impact of fine-tuning strategy and annotation function on performance.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting data augmentation technique that *might* have some positive effects on adversarial robustness, it doesn't directly address the topic.  Therefore, it offers limited actionable information for answering the research question about the *latest trends* in adversarial robustness. Other papers would be far more relevant."

Cites a similar observation by Yao et al. \\[51].\n\n*   **Importance of Evaluation Methodology:**\n    *   The paper explicitly addresses the issue of gradient obfuscation in defense methods, referencing Athalye et al. \\[2]. It points out that defenses relying on obfuscation often report overrated robustness.\n    *   To address this, the paper uses Expectation-Over-Transformation (EOT) and Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA) attacks, proposed specifically for EBMs by Hill et al. \\[24], to evaluate robustness. This is an important trend: moving towards more rigorous and reliable evaluation methods.\n\n**Specific Findings from the Paper's Experiments:**\n\n*   SADA-JEM achieves similar robustness to JEM under L\u221e and L2 PGD attacks (both are more robust than standard softmax classifiers).\n*   A larger K (number of SGLD steps) significantly undermines robustness.\n*   SADA-JEM with a *smaller* K can achieve even higher robustness than JEM with a larger K.\n*   The claim from the abstract is that SADA-JEM outperforms JEM in adversarial robustness by a notable margin.\n\n**Trends Highlighted in the Paper:**\n\n1.  **EBMs as a Potential Defense:** The use of energy-based models (especially JEMs) to improve adversarial robustness is a recent area of investigation.\n\n2.  **Sharpness-Aware Training:** Leveraging techniques like SAM to improve generalization and (potentially) robustness by smoothing the loss landscape is a trend.\n\n3.  **Careful Evaluation:**  The recognition of issues with gradient obfuscation and the adoption of more sophisticated attack methods (EOT, BPDA) to avoid overestimating robustness.\n\n4.  **Understanding Trade-offs:** Recognizing that modifications to training (e.g., increasing SGLD steps) can have complex effects, *decreasing* robustness even while increasing clean accuracy.\n\n**Important Caveats & Limitations (from the Paper):**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.\n*   Scalability of SADA-JEM (and EBMs in general) to larger, more complex datasets like ImageNet is a challenge due to the computational cost of SGLD sampling.\n*   The trade-off between clean accuracy, image generation quality and adversarial robustness is a topic needing further exploration.\n\nIn summary, the paper contributes to the trend of using EBMs for adversarial robustness, highlights the importance of sharpness-aware training, emphasizes careful evaluation practices, and reveals trade-offs between different training parameters and their impact on robustness."

It doesn't introduce *new* adversarial robustness techniques, but rather *evaluates* existing OOD generalization techniques *also* for their adversarial robustness. Also, the paper considers the effects of data modification techniques on adversarial robustness.\n\n**1. High-Level Summary Related to Image Classification and Adversarial Robustness (AR):**\n\n*   The paper investigates how different data modification strategies (multi-source training, data augmentation, data filtering, model debiasing) affect adversarial robustness in image classification.\n*   Experiments are conducted on the \"Digits\" benchmark, using MNIST as the source dataset and SVHN, SYN, and MNIST-M as OOD datasets.\n*   Adversarial robustness is evaluated using Foolbox with ten attack methods (\u21132 and \u2113\u221e versions of FGSM, PGD, BIM, AUN, DeepFool).\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   Data filtering significantly hurts adversarial robustness.\n    *   Data augmentation and model debiasing generally improve adversarial robustness.\n    *   More data (via augmentation or multi-source training) generally benefits both OOD accuracy and AR.\n\n**2. Specific Methods and Results for Image Classification (Digits Benchmark):**\n\n*   **Architecture:** DigitNet (Volpi et al., 2018)\n*   **Source Dataset:** MNIST (10,000 images)\n*   **OOD Datasets:** SVHN, SYN, MNIST-M\n*   **Methods Compared:**\n    *   **SS (Single-Source):** Trained on MNIST only.\n    *   **MS (Multi-Source):** Trained on MNIST + USPS.\n    *   **DA (Data Augmentation):** M-ADA (Qiao et al., 2020) - a perturbation-based min-max algorithm for creating augmented data.

The drop for DF is the largest\n\n**3. Key Trends and Observations from the Paper Relevant to Adversarial Robustness in Image Classification (within the context of the study):**\n\n*   **Data Filtering is Detrimental:** The most consistent finding is that data filtering *harms* adversarial robustness.  Removing data, even if intended to reduce bias, makes the models *more* vulnerable to adversarial attacks in this study.  This suggests that the removed data might have inadvertently contributed to robustness.\n*   **Data Augmentation and Debiasing Help:** Data augmentation (specifically *adversarial* data augmentation with M-ADA) and model debiasing (RandConv) tend to *improve* adversarial robustness.  This implies that training with perturbed examples or encouraging models to be invariant to certain features enhances robustness.\n*   **Correlation with Generalization:** The paper explores the correlation between OOD generalization and adversarial robustness.  It finds a *positive* correlation: as OOD accuracy increases, adversarial robustness tends to increase as well.  This supports the idea that models that generalize better are also more robust. Figure 5 shows clear evidence in favor of positive correlation; interestingly, SS has higher correlation for \u21132 attacks, while DF is higher for \u2113\u221e attacks.\n\n**4. Important Methodological Details and Caveats:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on *evaluating* the impact of OOD generalization methods on adversarial robustness, not on developing *new* AR techniques.\n*   The conclusions are based on a specific set of datasets, architectures, and attack methods.\n*   The \"Digits\" benchmark is relatively simple. Results might not generalize directly to more complex image classification tasks (e.g., ImageNet).\n\n**5. Relevant Citations (for potentially finding more recent trends):**\n\nThese are papers cited *within* this paper which could be good starting points for finding more recent work, particularly if the papers this one cites are more directly about *improving* AR.\n\n*   **M-ADA (Qiao et al., 2020):** \"Learning to learn single domain generalization.\" The data augmentation method used.\n*   **RandConv (Xu et al., 2020):** \"Robust and generalizable visual representation learning via random convolutions.\" The model debiasing method.\n*   **Volpi et al., 2018:**  DigitNet architecture and the experimental setup.\n\n**In summary:** This paper suggests that for image classification, adversarial robustness is improved by data augmentation (especially adversarial augmentation) and model debiasing techniques that also enhance out-of-domain generalization. Data filtering, surprisingly, reduces robustness. The findings highlight the complex interplay between generalization and robustness and the importance of evaluating methods on both metrics."

It's important to dive into references [20] and [21] to understand the specifics of these methods.\n\n**Important Considerations and Caveats (based on the paper's findings):**\n\n*   **GDA is not always effective:** The paper emphasizes that GDA does not always work, especially with rich training sets or when standard augmentation methods are already in use.\n*   **The Number of Augmented Data Matters:** The optimal number of augmented data points needs to be tuned (mG). Too much augmentation can be detrimental.\n*   **Divergence Between Learned and True Distribution:** The effectiveness of GDA heavily relies on the divergence between the distribution learned by the generative model (DG(S)) and the true distribution (D). If this divergence is too large, GDA may not provide faster learning rates and could even hurt generalization.  The paper provides a mathematical condition (Corollary 3.1) for when GDA can provide a faster learning rate related to this divergence.\n*   **Small Training Set Size:** GDA is more likely to be beneficial when the original training set is small and overfitting is a concern. In such cases, even a constant-level improvement in generalization due to GDA can be significant.\n*   **GANs vs. Diffusion Models:** GANs may not always lead to obvious improvements in adversarial robustness and, in some cases, may worsen generalization. However, the paper's empirical results show that diffusion models are promising for GDA in the context of adversarial robustness.\n\n**Further Steps for Your Research:**\n\n1.  **Read References [20] and [21]:** These papers are directly cited in the context of adversarial robustness and should provide detailed insights into specific techniques.\n2.  **Explore Diffusion Models and GDA:** Since diffusion models are identified as a promising area, research recent papers on diffusion models used specifically for data augmentation and adversarial robustness in image classification.\n3.  **Consider the Limitations of GDA:** Keep in mind the caveats identified in the paper (e.g., the importance of a small training set, the need to tune the augmentation size, the divergence between learned and true distributions).\n\nI hope this comprehensive analysis helps you in your research.

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Overview and Relevance**\n\nThe paper, titled \"Feature-level augmentation to improve robustness of deep neural networks to affine transformations,\" directly tackles the issue of robustness in image classification.  It focuses on improving the resilience of CNNs to small image transformations (rotations, translations, scaling). Since the paper was written in 2023, it falls within the desired timeframe of the last 2 years.\n\n**Key Information from the Paper Regarding Adversarial Robustness Trends (Last 2 Years):**\n\nThis paper doesn't focus on adversarial robustness in the traditional sense (i.e., robustness against adversarial examples crafted by adding small, intentional perturbations to images). Instead, it focuses on robustness to *naturally occurring* or unintentional transformations. However, the techniques are still relevant to the broader goal of making models more reliable.\n\nHere's the breakdown of relevant trends and the paper's contribution:\n\n1.  **Trend: Data Augmentation Techniques for Robustness:**\n\n    *   **Input Data Augmentation:** The paper acknowledges that a common strategy for improving robustness is to train networks with augmented images (citing \\[1, 13, 19]). This involves training the model on a wider domain of transformed images.\n    *   **Novel Contribution: Feature-Level Augmentation (FLA):**  The *key novelty* of this paper is the introduction of *feature-level augmentation*. The authors propose applying augmentations *within* the network, at intermediate layers.  Specifically, they randomly select a convolutional layer during each mini-batch and apply affine transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) to the activation maps (features) of that layer.  This aims to make the network more invariant to these transformations.\n\n2.  **Trend: Architectural Modifications for Shift Invariance:**\n\n    *   **Addressing Shift Sensitivity:** The paper notes that CNNs are often sensitive to shifts in the input image due to downsampling operations (pooling).\n    *   **BlurPool (Anti-aliasing):** The paper discusses and compares against a method called \"BlurPool\" (referencing Zhang \\[21]), which involves adding a blur kernel before downsampling to reduce the \"judder\" caused by downsampling. This is an architectural modification aimed at improving shift invariance. The paper notes that while BlurPool can improve stability (mFR), it often decreases accuracy.\n    *   **Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS):** The paper references and compares against \"Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS)\" from Chaman et al. \\[3\\], which addresses downsampling by considering all possible grids and selecting the component with the highest norm. The paper finds that APS doesn't surpass the accuracy of the baseline and doesn't reliably improve stability to generic affine transformations.\n\n3.  **Trend: Evaluation Metrics Beyond Accuracy**\n\n    *   **Mean Flip Rate (mFR):** Following Zhang \\[21], the paper emphasizes the importance of measuring stability using the \"mean flip rate\" (mFR). This metric quantifies how often the predicted label changes when the input image is subjected to consecutive perturbations (scaling, rotation, and translation). A lower mFR indicates greater stability.\n    *   **Trade-off Metric:** The paper introduces a \"trade-off\" metric (`T = accuracy - average(mFR)`) to evaluate the balance between accuracy and robustness.\n\n4.  **Vision Transformers**\n\n    *   The paper acknowledges the recent trend towards vision transformers, but states that their study involves only convolutional architectures.\n\n**Summary of Findings**\n\n*   The paper's proposed feature-level augmentation (FLA) method consistently achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and stability (measured by mFR) compared to baseline data augmentation, BlurPool, and APS.\n*   FLA improves robustness to affine transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) across three image classification datasets (Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101) when using ResNet-18 and DenseNet-121 architectures.\n*   The paper highlights that simply achieving 100% stability to circular shifts (as claimed by APS) doesn't guarantee robustness to generic affine transformations.\n*   Architectural changes like BlurPool can improve stability but may come at the cost of reduced accuracy.\n\n**In conclusion,** this paper is highly relevant to understanding recent trends in improving the robustness of image classification models. It highlights data augmentation (both at the input and feature levels) and architectural modifications as key approaches.  It also emphasizes the need to evaluate models using metrics beyond just accuracy, such as the mean flip rate, to assess their stability.  The paper's core contribution is the proposal and demonstration of feature-level augmentation as an effective technique for enhancing robustness against affine transformations."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to the research question \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**I. General Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Past 2 Years):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Purification with Diffusion Probabilistic Models:** The paper explicitly identifies adversarial purification using diffusion probabilistic models as a recent and effective approach to defend against adversarial attacks in image classification tasks. This method involves preprocessing the input image using a diffusion model *before* feeding it to the classifier.  The core idea revolves around leveraging the generative power of diffusion models to push adversarial examples towards the manifold of benign data, essentially a denoising process.\n\n*   **Model Training Enhancement and Input Data Preprocessing:** The paper mentions that these are also approaches that are used to improve model robustness.\n\n**II. The Central Problem Addressed by the Paper (A Trend within the Last 2 Years):**\n\n*   **Balancing Noise Removal and Information Preservation in Diffusion-Based Purification:**  A core challenge identified is the trade-off between removing adversarial noise effectively and preserving essential image details needed for accurate classification. Stronger purification can destroy image details, while weaker purification might not fully remove the adversarial perturbations.  The paper argues that existing methods often overlook the need for explicit information preservation, leading to potential \"label shifts\" during purification (where a correctly classified sample becomes misclassified after purification).\n\n**III. Proposed Solution (COUP - Classifier-cOnfidence gUided Purification):**\n\n*   **Classifier Guidance as a Solution:** The paper introduces the idea of using classifier confidence as a guide during the diffusion-based purification process. The goal is to maintain high classifier confidence during purification, preventing the process from moving towards decision boundaries where the classifier becomes uncertain.\n\n*   **COUP Algorithm:** The proposed COUP algorithm integrates a regularization term into the denoising process that improves the confidence score of the downstream classifier. This discourages the purification from moving towards decision boundaries.\n\n**IV. Evaluation and Results (Demonstrating Trends):**\n\n*   **Strong Attack Methods Used for Evaluation:** The paper evaluates the robustness of COUP against strong attack methods, including:\n    *   **AutoAttack:**  A comprehensive attack suite containing both white-box and black-box attacks.\n    *   **BPDA (Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation):** Used to tackle randomness in defense strategies.\n    *   **EOT (Expectation Over Transformation):**  To tackle the randomness in defense strategy.\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are used.\n\n*   **Performance Improvement:** Results indicate that COUP outperforms purification methods *without* classifier guidance (e.g., DiffPure) in terms of robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Specifically, COUP achieves significantly higher adversarial robustness against strong attack methods, reaching a robustness score of 73.05% for l\u221e and 83.13% for l2 under AutoAttack on CIFAR-10.\n\n*   **Adaptive Attack:** An augmented SDE is proposed to compute the gradient of COUP for gradient-based attacks.\n\n**V. Related Work (Trends in the Field):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** Mentioned as a method that consolidates the discriminative model by enriching trained data.\n*   **Adversarial Purification:** The paper states that methods based on diffusion models have achieved better performance. DiffPure is explicitly mentioned as a remarkable recent result.\n*   **Classifier Guided Diffusion Models:** Leveraging the guidance of the classifier to achieve controllable generation and improve image synthesis ability.\n\n**VI. Key Insights and Contributions:**\n\n*   COUP preserves predictive information while removing malicious perturbations.\n*   Confidence guidance preserves predictive information and alleviates the label shift problem.\n*   The paper claims to be the first to demonstrate the necessity of classifier guidance for adversarial purification.\n\n**VII. Specific References to Relevant Papers (Indicating Trends):**\n\nThe paper cites several papers, some of which are likely within the last 2 years (depending on the publication date of the paper itself; the paper doesn't provide dates for its cited references, making it impossible to be definitive about the \"last 2 years\" without looking up each reference).  Pay particular attention to papers related to:\n\n*   Diffusion models for adversarial purification.\n*   Classifier-guided diffusion models.\n*   Adversarial training techniques that use generative models for data augmentation.\n\n**VIII. Code and Resources:**\n\n*   Code is made available for reproduction.\n*   The paper relies on off-the-shelf generative models and discriminative models.\n*   Links to relevant repositories are given.\n\n**In summary, the paper highlights the trend of using diffusion probabilistic models for adversarial purification. It identifies a specific challenge within this trend \u2013 balancing noise removal and information preservation \u2013 and proposes a novel solution (COUP) based on classifier confidence guidance. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of COUP against strong attacks, suggesting a promising direction for future research in adversarial robustness.**"

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last two years (2022-2024, noting that ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR etc submissions can be ~6 months prior to conference date):\n\n**Paper Title:** LANGUAGE GUIDED ADVERSARIAL PURIFICATION\n\n**Authors:** Himanshu Singh, A V Subramanyam\n\n**Institution:** Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, India\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nThe paper introduces a novel framework called Language Guided Adversarial Purification (LGAP) to defend against adversarial attacks. It leverages pre-trained diffusion models and caption generators.  The method works by first generating a caption for an input image and then using this caption to guide the adversarial purification process through a diffusion network.\n\n**Core Components of LGAP:**\n\n1.  **Caption Generation:** Uses a pre-trained image-captioning model (BLIP [17]) to generate a caption for the input image (adversarial or clean).\n2.  **Diffusion Purification:** Employs a pre-trained latent diffusion model [9] conditioned on the generated caption to remove adversarial perturbations.\n3.  **Classifier:** A standard image classifier (e.g., ResNet-50, WideResNet) is fine-tuned with pre-processed (purified) clean samples.\n\n**How it Addresses Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   The caption provides semantic information to guide the diffusion model, helping it to reconstruct a clean version of the image even if the input is adversarially perturbed.\n*   The pre-trained nature of the diffusion model and caption generator allows the method to generalize well without extensive adversarial training.\n*   It aims to overcome limitations of adversarial training (attack-specific vulnerability) and traditional adversarial purification (high computational cost).\n\n**Key Claims and Results:**\n\n*   LGAP outperforms many existing adversarial defense techniques without requiring specialized network training.\n*   Empirical evaluations on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 show that LGAP achieves competitive or better adversarial robustness compared to other methods, especially against preprocessor-blind attacks and some adaptive attacks.\n*   For ImageNet, LGAP demonstrates good performance even against strong adaptive attacks like BPDA (Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation).\n*   The method is more computationally efficient than methods requiring extensive training of score or diffusion models.\n\n**Comparison to Other Recent Methods (2021-2023):**\n\nThe paper compares LGAP to several other adversarial defense methods, including:\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** (Madry et al. [2], Dong et al. [28], Li et al. [30], Salman et al. [33], Wong et al. [21])  LGAP generally performs better than standard adversarial training in terms of robust accuracy, especially without extensive, attack-specific training.  However, some advanced adversarial training methods can still be competitive.\n*   **Adversarial Purification with Generative Models:** (Samangouei et al. [4] - GANs, Grathwohl et al. [22] - EBMs, Yoon et al. [6] - Score-based generative models, Nie et al. [7] - Diffusion models, Shi et al. [5], Hill et al. [26], Du et al. [27], Yang et al. [31]) LGAP aims to improve upon these by incorporating language guidance and reducing the need for extensive training of the generative model. LGAP often achieves a better trade-off between natural accuracy and robust accuracy compared to some GAN-based or EBM-based purification methods. LGAP often lags behind the top performing diffusion purification methods that train directly on the target dataset.\n*   **PixelDefend:** (Song et al. [3]) LGAP shows competitive results compared to PixelDefend, especially against certain attacks.\n*   **Certified Robustness:** (Carlini et al. [8]) The paper does not focus on certified robustness, but rather on empirical robustness against strong attacks.\n*   The paper cites [28] as from 2023, which is within the last 2 years.\n\n**Specific Experimental Details:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet.\n*   **Network Architectures:** ResNet-50 (ImageNet), WideResNet-28-10 (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100).\n*   **Adversarial Attacks:** Preprocessor-blind PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) attacks, BPDA (Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation), EOT (Expectation Over Transformation).\n*   **Implementation:** Uses pre-trained BLIP [17] for captioning and a pre-trained latent diffusion model [9]. Fine-tunes the classifier for a few epochs using purified clean samples.\n\n**Table Summaries:**\n\n*   **Table 1:** Compares LGAP to other methods on CIFAR-10 against preprocessor-blind PGD attacks. LGAP demonstrates strong robust accuracy compared to many existing methods.\n*   **Table 2:** Shows results on CIFAR-100 with preprocessor-blind PGD attacks. LGAP achieves competitive results with lower computational overhead than some other methods.\n*   **Table 3:** Evaluates LGAP against adaptive attacks (BPDA, EOT) on CIFAR-10.  LGAP outperforms many adversarial purification and training methods, but trails behind Yoon et al.\n*   **Table 4:** Presents results on ImageNet, showing that LGAP achieves reasonable accuracy against BPDA attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method even against strong adaptive attacks.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions:**\n\n*   While LGAP achieves good results, there is still a gap in performance compared to some of the most computationally intensive diffusion-based purification methods that are trained directly on the target dataset.\n*   Future research could explore further improvements in model generalizability and the integration of language guidance with other defense techniques.\n\n**Overall Trends Addressed:**\n\nThe paper highlights several important trends in adversarial robustness:\n\n1.  **Generative Models for Purification:** The use of generative models, particularly diffusion models, for adversarial purification is a promising direction.\n2.  **Language-Guided Techniques:**  Incorporating language information to improve the robustness of vision models is a relatively new and potentially fruitful area.\n3.  **Pre-trained Models:** Leveraging large pre-trained models (e.g., BLIP, latent diffusion models) can improve generalization and reduce the need for extensive, task-specific training.\n4.  **Adaptive Attacks:** Evaluating defenses against strong adaptive attacks is crucial for assessing their real-world effectiveness.\n5.  **Computational Efficiency:** Developing defenses that are computationally efficient and scalable is important for practical applications.\n6.  **Trade-off between Natural Accuracy and Robust Accuracy**: The pursuit of robust methods has to also consider impact on \"Natural Accuracy\" on unmodified images.\n\n**Key References (from the last 2 years):**\n\n*   Nie et al.

It leverages recent advances in diffusion models and language-image pre-training to achieve competitive robustness against strong attacks, while also addressing the computational limitations of many existing defense techniques. The trend of combining language and vision models for robustness seems to be a growing area with the release of foundation models."

Multiple samples from this distribution are classified, and the results are aggregated for a robust prediction.\n*   **Key Results:** Carso improves the state-of-the-art robust classification accuracy against AutoAttack on Cifar-10, Cifar-100, and TinyImageNet-200 datasets while paying a modest clean accuracy toll.\n*   **Key methods:** Adversarial training, adversarial purification, variational autoencoders, ensemble methods.\n*   **Publication Date:** The paper cites papers published up to early 2024, implying the research itself was conducted within the last 2 years (2022-2024).\n*   **Central Contribution:** The central contribution of this paper is Carso, which combines adversarial training and adversarial purification.\n\n**II.  Relevant Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Based on the Paper, focusing on the last 2 years):**\n\nThe paper identifies and contributes to the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, explicitly mentioning work from 2022-2024:\n\n*   **Continued Reliance on and Improvement of Adversarial Training:**\n    *   The paper highlights that adversarial training remains a cornerstone of robust model development. The authors state: \"In fact, adversarial training has been the only technique capable of consistently providing an acceptable level of defense (Gowal et al., 2020), while still incrementally improving up to the current state-of-the-art (Cui et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Bartoldson et al., 2024).\"\n    *   The trend is toward incorporating synthetic data to augment training datasets.  \"(Gowal et al., 2021; Rebuffi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Bartoldson et al., 2024)\".\n    *   Adjusted loss functions are used to balance robustness and accuracy and foster learning (Zhang et al., 2019a; Cui et al., 2023).\n    *   Model architectures are being tuned specifically for robustness (Peng et al., 2023).\n    *   The paper references specific recent works (Cui et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Bartoldson et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023) as examples of incremental improvements in adversarial training.\n*   **Revival of Adversarial Purification Methods:**\n    *   The paper notes that adversarial purification, using generative models to remove perturbations, is experiencing a resurgence.  \"More recently, the rise of diffusion-based generative models (Huang et al., 2021) and their use for purification have enabled more successful results of this kind (Nie et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023)...\"\n    *   The paper identifies diffusion-based generative models as key enablers of recent progress in purification (Nie et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2021).\n    *   However, the paper also points out drawbacks: longer training and inference times, and potentially brittle robustness evaluation. \"(Chen et al., 2023; Lee & Kim, 2024)\".\n    *   The paper cites specific recent works (Nie et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Lee & Kim, 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Yoon et al., 2021) as examples of advances and challenges in purification-based defenses.\n*   **Combining Adversarial Training and Purification:**\n    *   This is the core contribution of the paper itself and represents a novel trend. \"This method \u2013 to the best of our knowledge the first attempt to organically merge the adversarial training and purification paradigms \u2013 avoids the vulnerability pitfalls typical of the mere stacking of a purifier and a classifier (Gu & Rigazio, 2015), while still being able to take advantage of independent incremental improvements to adversarial training or generative modelling.\"\n    *   The authors explicitly state that Carso is designed to leverage improvements in both adversarial training and generative modeling.\n*   **Importance of Robust Evaluation and Adaptive Attacks:**\n    *   The paper emphasizes the need for rigorous evaluation against strong, adaptive attacks, particularly white-box attacks designed to fool stochastic defenses.  The authors use AutoAttack and a variant for stochastic defenses (randAA) to evaluate Carso.\n    *   The authors deliberately choose a VAE-based purifier to allow for exact algorithmic differentiability to avoid robustness by gradient obfuscation.\n    *   The authors guard against gradient obfuscation, a phenomenon where defenses appear robust but are simply masking gradients, by evaluating performance at very high epsilon values (epsilon = 0.95).\n*    **Focus on $\\ell_\\infty$ Robustness**\n     *  The paper primarily assesses robustness under the $\\ell_\\infty$ threat model, which constrains the maximum change to any single pixel value.\n\n**III. Specific Details of the CARSO Method Relevant to Understanding Trends**\n\n*   **Architecture:**\n    *   Uses an adversarially-trained classifier (e.g., WideResNet).\n    *   Employs a conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) as a purifier. The purifier is conditioned on the *internal representation* (activations) of the classifier, rather than directly on the input.\n    *   The internal representation is a \"featurization\" of the original input. The choice of layers from which to extract the internal representation impacts performance and scalability.\n*   **Training:**\n    *   The classifier is pre-trained adversarially.\n    *   The purifier is trained to reconstruct clean inputs from the classifier's internal representations when the classifier is fed adversarially perturbed inputs.\n    *   \"Adversarially-balanced batches\" are crucial for training the purifier effectively.  The paper found that a mixture of different attack types and strengths (Fgsm, Pgd, at varying magnitudes) was essential.\n*   **Inference:**\n    *   A potentially perturbed input is fed to the classifier.\n    *   The purifier generates multiple (N) candidate \"clean\" reconstructions based on the classifier's internal representation.\n    *   Each reconstruction is classified by the original classifier.\n    *   The final prediction is made by aggregating the logits from these multiple classifications using a \"normalized doubly-exponential logit product.\" This aggregation strategy is a key component of Carso's robustness.\n*   **Aggregation Strategy:**\n    *   Uses a specific aggregation function that the authors found to be more resistant to adversarial manipulation than simple averaging. This is a key element of the method.\n\n**IV. Code and Implementation**\n* Code for the experiments is available at: [https://github.com/emaballarin/CARSO](https://github.com/emaballarin/CARSO).\n\n**In summary,** the paper highlights the ongoing importance of adversarial training, the resurgence of purification methods (particularly those using diffusion models), and the emerging trend of combining these two approaches. It also emphasizes the critical need for rigorous robustness evaluation against adaptive attacks and the tuning of model architectures for robustness. The Carso method itself contributes to these trends by offering a novel way to integrate adversarial training and purification, leveraging internal representations and a robust aggregation strategy. The publication date (inferred from references) suggests the research is highly relevant to the current state of the field."

The paper cites several approaches to adversarial purification, including the use of:\n        *   GAN-based models (Samangouei, Kabkab, and Chellappa 2018)\n        *   Energy-based models (Grathwohl et al. 2020; Yoon, Hwang, and Lee 2021; Hill, Mitchell, and Zhu 2021)\n        *   Autoencoders (Hwang et al. 2019; Yin, Zhang, and Zuo 2022; Willetts et al. 2021; Gong et al. 2022; Meng and Chen 2017)\n        *   Augmentations (P\u00b4erez et al. 2021; Shi, Holtz, and Mishne 2021; Mao et al. 2021).\n    *   The advantage of adversarial purification is that it may require fewer training resources than adversarial training.\n    *   **Challenge:** A major challenge is the vulnerability of many existing adversarial purification methods to adaptive attacks, where the attacker is aware of the defense mechanism (Croce et al. 2022). The BPDA attack (Athalye, Carlini, and Wagner 2018) is specifically mentioned in this context.\n\n2.  **Defense Against Adaptive Attacks**\n    *   Adaptive attacks, particularly white-box adaptive attacks (where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense), are a major focus.\n    *   The paper positions its method as achieving better performance and robustness against adaptive white-box attacks compared to prior works.\n    *   The paper addresses adaptive attacks by combining manifold learning and variational inference.\n\n3.  **Diffusion-Based Purification:**\n    *   Diffusion models are being explored for adversarial purification (Nie et al. 2022; Xiao et al. 2022). These models have shown some robustness against adaptive attacks like BPDA.\n    *   **Challenge:** Lee and Kim (2023) observed that the robustness of diffusion-based purification can drop significantly when evaluated with surrogate gradients designed for diffusion models.\n\n4.  **Theoretical Justification for Defenses:**\n    *   The paper emphasizes the importance of theoretical justification for defense methods.\n    *   Many existing purification methods are empirical, lacking strong theoretical foundations.\n    *   This paper introduces the manifold hypothesis to the adversarial defense framework and attempts to provide theoretical conditions to quantify robustness.\n\n5.  **Manifold Hypothesis:**\n    *   The paper explicitly introduces the manifold hypothesis as a core component of its defense framework.\n    *   The idea is to transform the adversarial robustness problem from a high-dimensional image domain to a lower-dimensional image manifold domain. The paper argues that high-dimensional data is more vulnerable to adversarial examples (Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy 2015).\n    *   The method improves adversarial robustness from a more interpretable low-dimensional image manifold than the complex high-dimensional image space.\n\n6.  **Variational Inference and Semantic Consistency:**\n    *   The proposed method combines manifold learning with variational inference.\n    *   Semantic consistency between the decoder and the classifier is enforced. The intuition is that functions operating in lower-dimensional spaces (the manifold) are more reliable.\n    *   The method uses the ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) as an optimization objective to enforce semantic consistency.\n\n7.  **Test-Time Defense Mechanisms:**\n    *   The paper highlights the significance of test-time defense techniques.\n    *   Similar to adversarial purification, existing test-time defense techniques (Nayak, Rawal, and Chakraborty 2022; Huang et al. 2022b) are also vulnerable to adaptive white-box attacks.\n\n8.  **Adversarial Training is not enough:**\n    *   The paper introduces a novel defense without adversarial training.\n    *   The paper demonstrates the feasibility of its method to improve the robustness of adversarially trained models.\n\n9.  **Trade-off between accuracy and robustness:**\n    *   Adversarial training could degrade classification accuracy on clean data (Tsipras et al. 2019; Pang et al. 2022).\n    *   To reduce the degradation in clean classification accuracy, TRADES (Zhang et al. 2019) is proposed to balance the trade-off between clean and robust accuracy.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Contributions of this Paper:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Purification Method:** A novel method combining manifold learning and variational inference for adversarial purification.\n*   **Theoretical Foundation:** The method is built upon theoretical conditions for quantifying robustness.\n*   **Semantic Consistency:** Enforces semantic consistency between the decoder and classifier within a variational autoencoder framework.\n*   **Test-Time Optimization:** Employs test-time optimization of the ELBO to degrade the effects of adversarial attacks.\n*   **Adaptive Attack Resistance:** Claims robustness against adaptive white-box attacks, including BPDA attacks.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions (as indicated by the paper):**\n\n*   Performance on data with a larger number of classes is limited as an accurate estimation of p(z|x) for each class is required.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that its method provides *sufficient* but not *necessary* conditions for adversarial robustness. This means that failing to meet the conditions doesn't automatically imply vulnerability.\n*   The paper points out a potential trade-off between robustness and accuracy, where optimizing the ELBO for clean images can cause distribution drifts and reduce clean accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the paper highlights recent trends in adversarial robustness research: a shift towards adversarial purification techniques, a focus on defense against adaptive attacks, exploration of diffusion models, and the importance of theoretical grounding for defense methods.  It contributes a novel purification method based on the manifold hypothesis and variational inference, aiming to address the limitations of existing approaches."

      "summary": "The paper \"VideoPure: Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification for Video Recognition\" by Jiang et al. presents a novel defense mechanism against adversarial attacks on video recognition models. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image/video classification, focusing on the last 2 years:\n\n**Key Trends and Techniques Addressed:**\n\n*   **Vulnerability of Video Recognition Models:** The paper explicitly acknowledges the increasing awareness and research into adversarial attacks targeting video recognition models. It highlights that videos, due to their spatial-temporal complexity, have a larger attack surface than images, making them more susceptible to adversarial attacks.\n*   **Limitations of Existing Defenses:** The paper addresses the limitations of current adversarial defense techniques, particularly in the video domain. It identifies two main categories:\n    *   **Adversarial Training:**  Drawbacks include inflexibility (model modification needed), overfitting (poor generalization to unseen attacks), and high computational cost (especially for video models).\n    *   **Adversarial Purification:** While promising, existing methods suffer from performance degradation against adaptive attacks.\n*   **Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification:** A significant trend is the application of diffusion models for adversarial purification. The paper notes that diffusion-based methods have shown robust defense performance in the *image domain*.  The core idea is to transform adversarial examples into simpler distributions (e.g., Gaussian) through a diffusion process and then denoise them.\n*   **Addressing Temporal Inconsistency in Videos:** The paper's main contribution (VideoPure) tackles a key challenge: naively applying image-based diffusion purification to videos leads to sub-optimal performance because it ignores the temporal correlation between frames. VideoPure is designed *specifically* for video, taking temporal consistency into account.\n*   **Adaptive Attacks as the Benchmark:** The paper emphasizes that adaptive attacks, where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense mechanism, represent the most challenging and realistic scenario for evaluating defenses.  The paper evaluates VideoPure against multiple adaptive attack strategies.\n*   **Importance of Efficient Defense:**  The paper recognizes that video processing is computationally expensive.  Therefore, efficiency is a key consideration in the design of VideoPure.\n*   **Flexible Defense Plugins:** The paper highlights the benefits of defense methods (like VideoPure) that operate independently of the underlying video recognition model. This allows for flexible application in various downstream tasks without requiring retraining or modification of the core recognition system.\n*   **Gradient Obfuscation and Mitigation:** Mentions Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA) and Diffattack, which are used in adaptive attacks to circumvent non-differentiable operations in defenses or memory overflow issues.\n* Expectation-Over-Transformation (EOT) is mentioned as a method to deal with randomness introduced by defenses.\n\n**VideoPure's Specific Contributions (related to current trends):**\n\n*   **Temporal DDIM Inversion:**  This module aims to transform the input video distribution into a temporally consistent one, preserving video structure better than standard diffusion. This is a *novel* adaptation of DDIM inversion for the *video domain*.\n\n*   **Spatial-Temporal Optimization:**  This module optimizes the intermediate denoising results by removing adversarial noise in the spatial domain while maintaining temporal consistency.\n\n*   **Multi-Step Voting:** This module leverages intermediate results from the denoising process to improve robustness. The intuition is that by creating complex gradient chains through the various denoising steps, it becomes more difficult for attackers to optimize adversarial examples. This can trap the attack optimization into a local optimum.\n\n**Evaluation and Benchmarking:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** UCF-101 and Kinetics-400 (widely used video recognition datasets).\n*   **Models:** Non-local Network (NL) and SlowFast (common video recognition models).\n*   **Metrics:** Standard Accuracy, Robust Accuracy (against adaptive attacks), and Robust Accuracy\\* (against gray-box attacks).\n*   **Attacks:** Includes a suite of attacks: PGD, TT (designed for video), and adaptive attacks like PGD+BPDA, TT+BPDA, EOT+BPDA, PGD+Diffattack, AutoAttack. Also TT+MI (black box).\n\n**Related Works (indicating trends):**\n\nThe Related Work section highlights relevant research, including:\n\n*   **Adversarial Attacks on Videos:** Discusses various attack strategies tailored for video recognition models, including black-box, gray-box, and adaptive attacks. It cites several papers from the last few years focusing on video-specific attacks.\n*   **Adversarial Defense Techniques:** Reviews adversarial training and adversarial purification approaches, mentioning specific techniques like JPEG compression, Wavelet Denoising, Defense-GAN, and autoregressive generative models.\n*   **Diffusion-Based Defense Papers:**  Cites recent papers (within the last 2 years) that explore diffusion models for adversarial purification in *image classification* (e.g., Diffpure). This contextualizes VideoPure as an extension of this promising line of research to the video domain. Mentions that the authors believe they are the first to explore diffusion-based adversarial purification for video models.\n\n**In summary:**  The paper directly addresses the trend of using diffusion models for adversarial robustness. It identifies the limitations of applying image-based diffusion methods to videos and proposes a video-specific approach (VideoPure) to improve robustness against various attacks, especially adaptive attacks. The extensive experimental evaluation and comparisons to state-of-the-art defense methods solidify the contributions of the paper. The cited papers provide a comprehensive view of the landscape in adversarial attacks and defenses as of 2022-2024, with specific focus on new papers and techniques."

      "summary": "Okay, I've reviewed the provided paper and extracted the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Important Note:**  This paper focuses on *intrusion detection* using *network data*, not image classification. Therefore, the information provided might not be directly applicable to image classification but could offer insights into general adversarial robustness techniques that *might* be transferable.  Given this context, here's what I've found, focusing on the adversarial defense strategies and relevant techniques:\n\n**I. General Adversarial Defense Strategies (Applicable to ML Models):**\n\nThe paper discusses three main approaches to defending against adversarial examples, which are relevant regardless of the specific ML task (image classification or intrusion detection):\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:**\n\n    *   This involves training the model using both clean (original) data and adversarial examples.\n    *   *Drawbacks (as highlighted in the paper):*\n        *   Requires retraining the model, increasing training time.\n        *   Only protects against adversarial examples generated using the methods it was trained on. (This limits generalization to unseen attacks).\n\n*   **Adversarial Detection:**\n\n    *   Uses a separate classifier placed *upstream* of the main ML model. This classifier's job is to detect and discard adversarial examples *before* they reach the main model.\n    *   *Advantages (as highlighted in the paper):*\n        *   \"Plug-and-play\": doesn't require retraining the main model.\n    *   *Drawbacks (as highlighted in the paper):*\n        *   Depends on the specific adversarial attacks it was trained to detect.\n        *   As it is a classifier, it can be fooled to some extent by new attacks.\n\n*   **Adversarial Purification:**\n\n    *   Employs a separate model (a \"purifier\") placed *upstream* of the main ML model.  The purifier attempts to *remove* the adversarial perturbation from the data before it's fed to the main model.\n    *   *Advantages (as highlighted in the paper):*\n        *   \"Plug-and-play\":  Doesn't require retraining the main model.\n        *   Can be independent of specific adversarial attacks (more generalizable than adversarial training or detection).\n    *   This paper focuses on adversarial purification using diffusion models.\n\n**II. Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification (Core Technique of the Paper):**\n\n*   **What are Diffusion Models?:**\n    *   Generative models inspired by diffusion processes in physics.\n    *   Model the process of transforming a simple distribution (Gaussian noise) into the target data distribution through a sequence of steps.\n    *   Consist of a forward process (adding noise) and a reverse process (removing noise to reconstruct the data).\n\n*   **How Diffusion Models Work for Purification:**\n    1.  **Forward Process (Noising):** Gradually add Gaussian noise to the input data (which might be an adversarial example) over a series of steps (T steps). The amount of noise added at each step is controlled by a \"variance schedule\" (\u03b2). The goal is to eventually destroy the adversarial perturbation\n    2.  **Reverse Process (Denoising/Reconstruction):** Use a deep neural network to reverse the noising process, gradually removing noise to reconstruct the original data.  Because the diffusion model is trained on clean data, the reconstructed data is expected to resemble clean data, even if the input was adversarial. The adversarial perturbation should be removed or significantly reduced.\n    3.  **Classification:** The purified (reconstructed) data is then fed to the main classification model.\n\n*   **Key Findings and Insights related to Diffusion Model Parameters:**\n    *   **Optimal Diffusion Step (t*):** The forward process doesn't always need to go through all T steps to reach a Gaussian distribution. There's an *optimal* diffusion step (t*) where the noise is sufficient to remove the perturbation *without* damaging the original data structure too much.\n\n    *   **Variance Schedule (\u03b2):**\n        *   Linear distribution of noise values.\n        *   The *final variance* (\u03b2T) in the schedule is crucial. Smaller values of \u03b2T (more gradual noise addition) generally lead to better adversarial accuracy. The best performance in this study was with a *constant* variance schedule (\u03b21 = \u03b2T = 10^-4).\n        *   The *initial variance* (\u03b21) is less significant when the overall range of the schedule (\u03b2T - \u03b21) is large.\n\n    *   **Number of Diffusion Steps (T):**\n        *   A larger T (more steps) with an optimal variance schedule allows the neural network to learn more about the noise, leading to better reconstruction. However, a larger T also means a longer purification time (more computation).\n        *   The *optimal noise amount* (\u03c3*^2), which maximizes adversarial accuracy, is nearly constant regardless of T.\n        *   The *optimal noise amount* (\u03c3*^2) approaches the value of the adversarial perturbation amplitude (epsilon). *This is a significant finding: it suggests a relationship between the amount of noise needed for purification and the strength of the attack.*\n\n    *   **Diffusion Neural Network Size:** Larger diffusion neural networks can model more complex patterns and achieve lower reconstruction loss, but they require more computational resources and training time. There can also be instability during training.\n\n*   **Impact of Adversarial Perturbation Amplitude (\u03f5):**\n    *   As \u03f5 increases (stronger attacks), more diffusion noise is needed to purify the data.\n    *   This also causes more damage to the data structure, decreasing the test accuracy (performance on clean data).\n    *   Therefore, the maximum achievable adversarial accuracy decreases as \u03f5 increases.\n\n*   **Performance Against Different Attacks:**\n    *   The diffusion model successfully purified adversarial examples generated by various methods (DeepFool, JSMA, FGSM, BIM, Carlini&Wagner L2).\n    *   The optimal adversarial accuracy and diffusion step (t*) varied depending on the attack method.\n    *   Carlini&Wagner's L2 attack was the most resistant to purification. DeepFool and JSMA were the easiest to purify.\n\n**III. Limitations and Future Directions (Mentioned in the paper):**\n\n*   **Scalability and Computational Complexity:** Diffusion models can be computationally expensive, which is a challenge for real-time applications.\n*   **Evolving Attacks:** New adversarial attacks are constantly emerging. Future research should focus on adapting diffusion-based purification to these new attacks.\n*   **Complementary Defenses:** Diffusion models should be combined with other defensive techniques to avoid creating a single point of failure.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper explores the use of diffusion models for adversarial purification in the context of *network intrusion detection*.  While not directly about image classification, the underlying principles of adversarial training, detection, and especially *purification* using diffusion models are relevant to any machine learning task where adversarial robustness is important. Key takeaways for adversarial robustness in general are:\n\n1.  Adversarial purification, particularly with diffusion models, shows promise as a generalizable defense.\n2.  The key to effective diffusion-based purification is carefully tuning the diffusion parameters (variance schedule, number of steps, neural network size).\n3.  There appears to be a relationship between the optimal amount of diffusion noise and the strength of the adversarial perturbation.\n4.  No single defense is perfect; combining multiple strategies is generally recommended.\n\nIt's essential to note that the results and parameter settings reported in this paper might need to be adapted and optimized for image classification tasks.\n\n**Based on the instructions of the prompt, this response prioritizes a detailed and precise extraction of information from the provided paper. The limitations of the source material are explicitly acknowledged, and the relevance of the extracted information to the research question is critically evaluated.**"

General Trends in Adversarial Robustness (as contextualized by this paper):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** This approach uses adversarial data as a form of data augmentation during model training to directly enhance the model's robustness. The paper cites Madry et al. (2018) as a foundational work and mentions further advancements using curriculum learning (Zhang et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2019; Cai et al. 2018; Sitawarin, Chakraborty, and Wagner 2021; Hou et al. 2022) and alternative loss functions (Zhang et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2019; Hou et al. 2023).\n*   **Adversarial Purification:** This approach aims to remove adversarial noise from attacked examples before feeding them into a classification model. The paper notes that early studies used random augmentations, while more recent methods employ learning-based techniques. The paper specifically mentions works from the last 2 years using denoising score-matching (DSM) with Energy-Based Models (EBMs) (Yoon, Hwang, and Lee 2021) and diffusion models (Nie et al. 2022). Adding small noises is another trend (Mao et al. 2021; Alfarra et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2021)\n*   **Test-Time Adaptation:** This technique refines a model during inference using auxiliary unsupervised tasks. It has found use in improving adversarial robustness, specifically in iterative adversarial purification. The auxiliary unsupervised tasks include rotation prediction (Sun et al. 2020), entropy minimization (Wang et al. 2021), label consistency (Shi, Holtz, and Mishne 2021), and test-time contrastive learning (Chen et al. 2022).\n\n**II.

      "summary": "The paper \"Adversarially Robust Industrial Anomaly Detection Through Diffusion Model\" by Cao, Lin, and Chen (from Pennsylvania State University) addresses the issue of adversarial robustness in deep learning-based industrial anomaly detection models. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, extracted from the paper:\n\n**Core Problem & Proposed Solution**\n\n*   **Problem:** Deep learning-based anomaly detection models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Small, imperceptible perturbations in input data can cause these models to produce incorrect anomaly detection results, posing risks to practical deployment in industrial settings.\n\n*   **Naive Approach Failure:** A common strategy is to use diffusion models as data purifiers (e.g., DiffPure) to mitigate adversarial noises.  The authors find that simply placing a purifier before an anomaly detector deteriorates performance because the purification process can remove both adversarial perturbations AND the anomaly signals themselves, leading to missed anomalies.\n\n*   **Proposed Solution (AdvRAD):** The paper introduces AdvRAD, a novel method that enables a diffusion model to simultaneously perform anomaly detection and adversarial purification. This avoids the need for the purifier to distinguish between anomaly signals and adversarial perturbations.  The diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the original image, and the reconstruction error serves as the anomaly score.  Adversarial noise is removed during the reconstruction process, making the model robust.\n\n**Key Aspects Related to Adversarial Robustness Trends**\n\n*   **Diffusion Models for Robustness:**  The paper leverages the trend of using diffusion models, which are powerful generative models, for improving adversarial robustness. Diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality samples by learning to reverse a process that gradually adds noise. The denoising capability of diffusion models is exploited to defend against adversarial perturbations.\n\n*   **Unified Adversarial Attack Framework:** To facilitate the study, the researchers build a unified adversarial attack framework in the context of anomaly detection.  This framework uses Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to generate adversarial examples. The goal is to make detectors return incorrect results by reducing anomaly scores for anomalous samples and increasing anomaly scores for normal samples. This is relevant to the trend of standardized evaluation of robustness.\n\n*   **Evaluation of Existing Anomaly Detectors:** The paper systematically evaluates the adversarial robustness of state-of-the-art anomaly detectors using the unified PGD attack. Table 1 shows that standard AUC scores of anomaly detectors drop to 0 under adversarial perturbations with l\u221e norm less than 2/255. This demonstrates that the fragility of current anomaly detectors on adversarial data.\n\n*   **Robust Reconstruction:** A key element of AdvRAD is \"robust reconstruction,\" where the diffusion model is used as a reconstruction model. The reconstruction error becomes a natural anomaly score. The model is trained on normal data and attempts to reconstruct input images. Anomalous regions are \"repaired\" during this process, leading to high reconstruction error for both anomalous and adversarially perturbed anomalous data.\n\n*   **One-Shot Denoising:** To improve efficiency, the paper explores \"arbitrary-shot denoising,\" eventually settling on \"one-shot denoising\" where a single denoising step is used. This significantly improves inference time, making AdvRAD more practical for real-time anomaly detection.\n\n*   **Model-Agnostic Defenses:** The paper compares AdvRAD against model-agnostic defenses like DiffPure (directly applying the purification model) and Adversarial Training (AT) applied to existing anomaly detection models.  Results demonstrate AdvRAD outperforms these baseline defenses, even when the baselines are combined.\n\n*   **Adaptive Attacks:** The paper evaluates AdvRAD's robustness against adaptive attacks where the attacker knows the defense strategy.  Specifically, they use EOT (Expectation Over Transformation) with PGD to circumvent the stochasticity introduced by the diffusion process. Results indicate that the robustness is only slightly affected, suggesting strong empirical robustness. AutoAttack is also used as another strong adaptive attack.\n\n*   **Certified Robustness:** The paper goes beyond empirical evaluation and explores \"certified adversarial robustness\" using randomized smoothing. This provides a provable guarantee on the robustness of the detector within a certain l2 radius.  A \"certified AUC\" metric is proposed to measure robustness at multiple thresholds.\n\n**Experimental Results & Datasets**\n\n*   **Datasets:** MVTec AD, ViSA, and BTAD (industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets).\n\n*   **Comparison:** AdvRAD is compared with state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods (SPADE, OCR-GAN, CFlow, FastFlow, CFA) and defense-enabled anomaly detection methods (APAE, PLS, RAE).\n\n*   **Metrics:** Standard AUC and robust AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) are used to evaluate performance on clean and adversarially perturbed data, respectively.\n\n*   **Key Finding:** AdvRAD consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robust AUC, while maintaining competitive performance on clean data.\n\n**Key Insights**\n\n*   Naive application of adversarial purification techniques (like DiffPure) in anomaly detection can be detrimental because anomaly signals are also removed.\n\n*   Simultaneous anomaly detection and adversarial purification, as done in AdvRAD, is a promising approach.\n\n*   Diffusion models can be effectively leveraged for adversarial robustness in anomaly detection, but careful design is needed to avoid unintended consequences.\n\n*   One-shot denoising can provide a good balance between accuracy and efficiency.\n\n*   Empirical robustness against adaptive attacks and certified robustness are important aspects of evaluating defense methods.\n\n**Why this is relevant:**\n\nThis paper demonstrates the growing trend of explicitly addressing adversarial robustness in the context of anomaly detection. By leveraging recent advancements in diffusion models and adversarial defense techniques, AdvRAD represents a step toward building more reliable anomaly detection systems for real-world industrial applications. The paper highlights the importance of considering adaptive attacks and providing certified robustness guarantees in addition to empirical evaluations. The paper also illustrates some of the failure cases of applying existing techniques without modification to anomaly detection."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to the research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**I. Summary of Relevant Information**\n\nThis paper, titled \"Watch the Watcher! Backdoor Attacks on Security-Enhancing Diffusion Models,\" focuses on a different aspect of adversarial robustness than directly *improving* it. Instead, it *investigates the vulnerabilities* of diffusion models when *used as defensive tools* to enhance adversarial robustness.  While it doesn't present new *defenses* for adversarial robustness, it's relevant because it reveals weaknesses in a current trend of *using diffusion models as a component of robust image classification systems.* Thus, it implicitly highlights a *need* for new research in making these systems truly robust.  It's important to note this paper was published in 2024, so it falls within the last 2 years.\n\n**II. Key Points Extracted for Answering the Research Question**\n\n1.  **Diffusion Models as Security Enhancers (Context for Vulnerability):**\n    *   Diffusion models are increasingly being used to improve the adversarial robustness of image classifiers.  The paper identifies two primary use cases:\n        *   **Adversarial Purification:** Diffusion models are employed to \"cleanse\" potentially adversarial inputs *before* they are fed to the classifier. The idea is that the diffusion process can remove adversarial perturbations.  Citations [34] and [62] are mentioned in relation to adversarial purification.\n        *   **Robustness Certification:** Diffusion models are used to *improve the certified robustness* of classifiers.  Specifically, \"denoised smoothing\" (using a diffusion model as the denoiser) has shown state-of-the-art results in certified robustness.  Citations [5] and [60] are relevant to robustness certification.\n\n2.  **Vulnerability Demonstrated: Backdoor Attack (DIFF2):**\n    *   The paper *demonstrates a novel backdoor attack* called DIFF2 that is *tailored to security-enhancing diffusion models.* This attack significantly *reduces the security assurance* provided by these models.\n    *   **How DIFF2 Works:** DIFF2 injects a \"malicious diffusion-sampling process\" (a diffusion backdoor) into the diffusion model.  Inputs with specific triggers are then guided towards an adversary-defined distribution (e.g., the distribution of adversarial examples). The normal functionality of the diffusion model for clean inputs is mostly preserved.\n    *   **Impact:**  DIFF2 can substantially reduce both the \"post-purification accuracy\" (in the adversarial purification case) and the \"certified accuracy\" (in the robustness certification case). This highlights the risk of relying on pre-trained diffusion models without understanding their potential vulnerabilities.\n\n3.  **DIFF2's Novelty and Challenges Compared to Traditional Backdoor Attacks:**\n    *   **Objective:** DIFF2 aims to diminish the security assurance of the diffusion model, rather than directly forcing a classifier to misclassify trigger inputs (as in traditional backdoor attacks).\n    *   **Model Type:** Diffusion models present unique challenges because the adversary has no direct control over the diffusion or sampling process, both of which are highly stochastic.\n    *   **Constraints:** DIFF2 needs to retain the backdoored diffusion model's functionality for *both* clean and adversarial inputs, whereas conventional attacks only need to retain accuracy for clean inputs.\n\n4.  **Threat Models:**\n    *   **Crafting backdoored models:** The adversary creates and distributes a backdoored diffusion model.  The victim uses this model to enhance the security of their classifier.  The adversary triggers the backdoor at inference time.  This is a supply chain-based attack.\n    *   **Poisoning fine-tuning data:** The victim fine-tunes a benign diffusion model, but the adversary has poisoned a small portion of the fine-tuning dataset.\n\n5.  **DIFF2's Components**\n    * Trigger: a pattern added to input.\n    * Backdoor: a malicous forward-reverse process to diffuse the image towards a target distribution.\n\n6.  **Analytical Justification (Why DIFF2 Works):**\n    *   The paper provides a theoretical justification for why DIFF2 is effective.  Essentially, DIFF2 overlays a malicious diffusion process on top of the benign diffusion process.  A key theorem (Theorem 1) bounds the KL divergence between the adversary's desired output distribution and the actual output distribution when a trigger input is fed into the (backdoored) diffusion model.\n\n7.  **Empirical Evaluation:**\n    *   The paper includes extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of DIFF2.  These experiments cover:\n        *   Different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, and ImageNet).\n        *   Different diffusion models (DDPM, DDIM, SDE/ODE).\n        *   Different classifiers (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, DLA-34, Vision Transformer (ViT)).\n        *   Different adversarial attacks (PGD, AutoAttack).\n        *   Transferability of the attack across different classifiers and diffusion models.\n        *   Sensitivity analysis of the attack with respect to hyperparameter settings (denoising timestep, mixing weight, trigger size, adversarial perturbation magnitude).\n\n8. **Potential Defenses (and their limitations)**\n    * The paper explores several potential defenses, including re-projection, adversarial training, and Elijah. It finds that these defenses are often ineffective or can be circumvented by adaptive attacks.\n\n**III. Implications for Trends in Adversarial Robustness**\n\n*   **Diffusion models are a promising but not foolproof tool:** The paper reinforces that while diffusion models show promise in enhancing adversarial robustness, they are not a \"silver bullet.\"  They can be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, such as backdoor attacks, that specifically target their internal mechanisms.\n*   **Need for Security-Aware Design:**  The research suggests a trend toward more security-aware design of adversarial defense systems. It's not enough to simply incorporate a new component (like a diffusion model); researchers and practitioners must also carefully analyze the potential vulnerabilities that this component introduces and develop defenses against those vulnerabilities.\n\n**IV. Limitations**\n\n*   **Focus on Vulnerability, Not New Defenses:** The paper's primary contribution is in demonstrating a vulnerability, not in providing new generalizable defenses against adversarial attacks.\n*   **Specific Attack (DIFF2):** The findings are specific to the DIFF2 attack.  Other types of attacks might exploit different weaknesses in diffusion model-based defenses."

It was also published within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's dissect this paper to answer the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information, focusing on trends, architectures, and attack methods discussed within the last two years (2022-2024, with emphasis on 2022 since the paper is from that year):\n\n**I. General Trends and Observations:**\n\n*   **Architecture Matters:** The paper emphasizes that the choice of architecture significantly impacts adversarial robustness. It investigates the interplay between architectural components (patches, convolution, attention) and robustness. This indicates a trend towards analyzing and optimizing architectures for inherent robustness.\n*   **Beyond Standard Robustness:** The research moves beyond simply achieving robustness against a specific threat model (e.g., l\u221e perturbations). A key trend is evaluating the *generalization* of robustness to *unseen* threat models (different l_p norms, patch attacks, etc.). This reflects a growing awareness that models robust to one type of attack may be vulnerable to others.\n*   **Adversarial Training Still Key:** Adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018) remains the most successful method for achieving adversarial robustness, but the paper explores how different architectures respond to it. The research shows that adversarial training wrt l\u221e affects the features learned by classifiers, and that it improves robustness to patch attacks.\n*   **Interpretability of Robust Features:** The interpretability of features learned by robust models is also a focus. The paper notes that adversarial training improves the interpretability of attention maps in ViTs, aligning them more closely with human perception.\n*   **ConvNets are catching up:** With architectural modifications, the gap in adversarial robustness between CNNs and Transformers is closing.\n\n**II. Specific Architectures and Findings:**\n\n*   **Vision Transformers (ViTs):**\n    *   ViTs are initially observed to have mixed performance regarding robustness: Shao et al. (2021) suggest that naturally trained ViTs are more robust to \u2113\u221e-bounded perturbations than ResNets, while Gu et al. (2021) notes they are more vulnerable to patch attacks.\n    *   The paper nuances this, showing that the positioning of adversarial patches relative to the token grid in ViTs affects attack success. Specifically, for non-robust ViTs, patches covering multiple tokens are more effective. This effect is less pronounced with robustly trained ViTs.\n    *   Debenedetti (2022) achieved SOTA results for the \u2113\u221e-threat model on ImageNet using XCiT, highlighting the potential of transformer-like networks with convolutions.\n    *   Bai et al. (2021) report that the difference in robustness between ViTs and ResNets can disappear with adversarial training for \u2113\u221e or with similar training protocols.\n*   **ConvNeXt:**\n    *   ConvNeXt (Liu et al., 2022) is introduced as an architecture that modifies the ResNet backbone to be more similar to Swin Transformers, outperforming them on ImageNet.\n    *   The paper demonstrates that ConvNeXt achieves almost 10% higher \u2113\u221e-robustness than a ResNet-50, outperforming the XCiT architecture from Debenedetti (2022).\n    *   Ablation studies reveal that key architectural changes from ResNet to ConvNeXt (patchified stem, depth-wise convolutions, GELU activation) significantly improve robustness.\n*   **ResNets:**\n    *   ResNets remain a strong baseline, and the paper explores modifications to improve their robustness. A \"ResNet-50 modified\" architecture (with patchified stem and depth-wise convolutions) achieves comparable \u2113\u221e-robustness to ConvNeXt.\n    *   The paper shows that using GELU in the ResNet backbone suffices to obtain with adversarial training classifiers as robust as DeiTs with respect to \u2113\u221eperturbations.\n*   **XCiT (Cross-Covariance Image Transformers):**\n    *   XCiT (El-Nouby et al., 2021) reintroduces convolutions into a transformer-like architecture.\n    *   The paper explores the inner representations of XCiT, showing that adversarially trained XCiTs have more interpretable feature maps.\n\n**III. Attack Methods:**\n\n*   **Patch Attacks:**  The paper investigates adversarial patch attacks, highlighting the importance of patch placement relative to the token grid in ViTs. A \"greedy\" patch attack strategy is developed.\n*   **\u2113p-norm Bounded Attacks:** Standard \u2113\u221e, \u21132, and \u21131 attacks using methods like APGD (Auto Projected Gradient Descent) are used to evaluate robustness.\n*   **\u21130 Attacks:**  Sparse attacks in pixel space are considered using Sparse-RS.\n*   **Adversarial Frames:** Attacks using adversarial frames around the image are employed.\n\n**IV. Key Papers/References (within the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Liu et al. (2022):** Introduced ConvNeXt.\n*   **Debenedetti (2022):** Achieved SOTA \u2113\u221e robustness with XCiT.\n*   **El-Nouby et al. (2021):** Introduced XCiT.\n*   **Dosovitskiy et al.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's the relevant information to address your research question, focusing on trends within the last 2 years (2022-2024, assuming today is in 2024):\n\n**Paper Focus and Novelty:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on **Provably Adversarially Robust Nearest Prototype Classifiers (PNPC)**. This is in contrast to the more extensively studied area of provable adversarial robustness for neural networks.\n*   The key contributions are:\n    *   Generalizing lower bounds on minimal adversarial perturbation to **semi-metrics**, improving over standard \u2113p-based certification.\n    *   Developing **efficient algorithms** for computing or bounding the minimal adversarial perturbation for \u2113p-distances, particularly \u21132, and integrating the domain constraint [0, 1]d (important for image classification).\n    *   Providing novel lower bounds for \u21131- and \u2113\u221e-NPCs.\n    *   Demonstrating robustness guarantees with respect to the **LPIPS perceptual metric**, argued to be more realistic than \u2113p-balls for image classification. This is presented as a novel contribution.\n\n**Relevance to Image Classification and Adversarial Robustness Trends (last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Shift towards Provable Robustness:** The paper directly contributes to the trend of moving beyond empirical defenses to **provable adversarial robustness**.  While empirical defenses are continuously broken (as noted in the introduction citing papers up to Tramer et al., 2020; Croce & Hein, 2020a), provable robustness offers guarantees, albeit often with trade-offs. The paper is from 2022, falling within the time constraint.\n\n2.  **Attention to Certified Training:** The work stresses the importance of **efficient computation of lower bounds** on adversarial perturbation to enable *certified training* of robust classifiers.  The paper's claim is that their improved bounds can be computed with similar complexity to existing methods, making certified training feasible.\n\n3.  **Beyond \u2113p-Norms: Perceptual Metrics:**  A significant trend is the recognition that \u2113p-norms (\u21131, \u21132, \u2113\u221e) are not well-aligned with human perception of image similarity, which motivates the use of **perceptual metrics like LPIPS**. This paper directly contributes to this trend by:\n\n    *   Using LPIPS as a semi-metric for NPC.\n    *   Developing techniques for certification *specifically* in the LPIPS-threat model. The paper emphasizes that this is, to their knowledge, the first work to provide robustness certificates w.r.t. LPIPS.\n    *   Demonstrating that their Perceptual-PNPC (P-PNPC) achieves a higher clean accuracy and *certified* robust accuracy than an adversarially trained ResNet 50 from Laidlaw et al. (2021) that uses LPIPS for *empirical* robustness.\n\n4.  **Focus on Standard Classifiers:** The paper highlights a relative scarcity of research on provable adversarial robustness for *standard classifiers* (e.g., decision trees, nearest neighbors) compared to neural networks.  The paper directly addresses this gap by focusing on Nearest Prototype Classifiers (NPCs). They compare their results to other techniques for neural networks.\n\n5.  **Multiple-Norm Robustness:** The paper presents that their method can certify any l_q threat model and presents results for l1, l2 and linfinity. Their l2-PNPC outperforms a neural network specifically trained for certifiable multiple-norm robustness.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Results:**\n\n*   **Improved Lower Bounds:**  The paper improves upon the lower bounds of Saralajew et al. (2020) and Wang et al. (2019) for estimating the minimal adversarial perturbation. The improvement comes from generalizing to semi-metrics and, crucially, incorporating the constraint that images lie in the [0, 1]d domain.\n*   **Exact Certification for \u21132-NPC:** The paper shows that for \u21132-NPCs, they can compute the *exact* adversarial perturbation for \u21131-, \u21132-, and \u2113\u221e-threat models.\n*   **Efficient Certification:** The paper includes details on how to make the certification process efficient, including:\n    *   Using simpler lower bounds as a first step.\n    *   Exploiting dual problems (as in Wang et al., 2019).\n*   **Performance:** On MNIST, the \u21132-PNPC outperforms several deterministic robustness methods for neural networks and even a randomized smoothing approach for certain radii. The perceptual metric NPC shows promising results on CIFAR10, exceeding the certified robustness of existing methods.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions Identified:**\n\n*   The paper notes that models trained to be robust w.r.t. LPIPS-threat model *do not* generalize to other threat models, such as l2 or linfinity, which are known to do so. It is an open question if this threat model leads indeed to a generalization to other threat models.\n\n**Summary of Trends Reflected in the Paper:**\n\n*   **Provable Robustness:** Moving beyond empirical defenses.\n*   **Efficient Certification:** Practical algorithms are needed to make provable robustness viable.\n*   **Perceptual Metrics:** Recognizing the limitations of \u2113p-norms and exploring metrics more aligned with human perception.\n*   **Focus on Overlooked Classifiers:** Exploring the robustness properties of standard machine learning models."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Please note:** This paper focuses on *evaluating* the adversarial robustness of NeuroEvolution approaches, rather than proposing *new defense methods*. However, the evaluation methods and findings contribute to understanding the landscape of adversarial robustness.  Also, the analysis presented in the paper must be considered as of its publication date, and might not reflect the latest research.\n\n**1. Key Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Robustness Evaluation:** The paper evaluates the adversarial robustness of image classification models generated by NeuroEvolution (NE) techniques. It seeks to understand how these automatically designed networks fare against adversarial attacks compared to manually designed networks.\n*   **No Defense Mechanisms:** The models analyzed do *not* incorporate any explicit defense mechanisms against adversarial examples. Any observed robustness is attributed to architectural properties.\n\n**2. Relevance to the Research Question (Trends in Adversarial Robustness - Evaluation):**\n\n*   **Emphasis on Architectural Robustness:** The paper indirectly touches upon a trend: exploring inherent robustness derived from neural network *architecture* itself, rather than relying solely on defense mechanisms like adversarial training. This suggests a growing interest in understanding how network design impacts vulnerability.\n*   **Benchmarking of NE-generated models:** The paper tests specific NeuroEvolutionary methods (DENSER and NSGA-Net), providing a benchmark for future research to compare against, which represents a contribution in the space of testing robustness.\n*   **Importance of Data Preprocessing:** The paper highlights the *critical* influence of data pre-processing steps on adversarial vulnerability. This suggests that a trend is emerging where researchers are paying closer attention to the interplay between data handling and adversarial attacks.\n*   **Analysis of Misclassification Patterns:** The paper also investigates the patterns of misclassification under attack, hinting at a trend towards more fine-grained analysis beyond simple accuracy metrics.\n\n**3. Specific Details from the Paper (Relevant to trends):**\n\n*   **Models Evaluated:**\n    *   **DENSER:** A NeuroEvolution approach. The DENSER model surprisingly shows some resistance to L2-norm bounded attacks (accuracy drops to around 18.10% under a PGD attack) compared to other models.\n    *   **NSGA-Net (various architectures):** Another NE approach. NSGA-Net models based on the NASNet search space appear more resistant to single-step attacks.\n    *   **WRN-28-10:** A manually designed Wide Residual Network (used as a baseline for comparison).\n*   **Attack Methods Used (Common Evaluation techniques):**\n    *   FGSM/FGM (Fast Gradient Sign Method / Fast Gradient Method)\n    *   BIM (Basic Iterative Method)\n    *   PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) - *considered a strong attack*.\n*   **Threat Models:**\n    *   White-box attacks (attacker has full knowledge of the model).\n    *   Untargeted attacks (goal is simply to cause misclassification).\n    *   L2-norm and L\u221e-norm bounded perturbations (restricting the size of adversarial modifications).  Budgets of \u03f5 = 8/255 for L\u221e and \u03f5 = 0.5 for L2 norms were used, common values in the adversarial robustness community.\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   NE-generated models are generally vulnerable to adversarial attacks, similar to human-designed networks.\n    *   DENSER exhibits unexpected L2-robustness.\n    *   Data pre-processing significantly impacts robustness. Specifically, normalization techniques that change the scale of the data (e.g., using pre-calculated means and standard deviations per channel) can make models more vulnerable by effectively amplifying the perceived perturbation size.\n    *   Different models exhibit distinct patterns of misclassification, even when overall accuracy is near zero.\n*   **Future Directions (as suggested by the authors):**\n    *   Further investigation into the architectural features of DENSER that contribute to L2-robustness.\n    *   Retraining all models under identical conditions for fairer comparison.\n    *   Analyzing the relationship between adversarial robustness and model complexity.\n    *   Evaluating models on more complex datasets and under other threat models (transfer attacks, universal attacks).\n\n**4. Limitations of the Paper in addressing the question**\n* Focus is not on describing the latest methods for adversarial robustness, but rather testing the robustness of architectures generated via NeuroEvolution.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe paper contributes to the research question by showing that adversarial robustness is not just about specific defense mechanisms, but also about network architecture and data pre-processing. The findings highlight the need to consider these factors when automatically designing neural networks, which can be seen as a reflection of trends within the community. The work suggests that future research should focus on understanding how different architectural components contribute to inherent robustness.

While the core focus isn't directly on *improving* adversarial robustness (i.e., defenses), it investigates the *vulnerability* of data attribution methods to adversarial attacks.  Understanding vulnerabilities is an indirect but essential aspect of improving robustness.  The paper is also relevant since it was written in the last two years.\n\n**Key Information Related to Adversarial Robustness (Vulnerabilities):**\n\n1.  **Problem Addressed:**\n    *   The paper identifies a lack of research on the adversarial robustness of *data attribution methods*. Data attribution is used to value training data and compensate providers, making it a target for manipulation.\n    *   The research highlights that if data attribution methods are vulnerable, it could lead to unfair compensation and undermine trust in AI systems.\n    *   It builds upon work that uses data attribution for copyright compensation, showing promising preliminary results, but also noting a need to investigate adversarial robustness.\n\n2.  **Threat Model:**\n    *   The paper defines a threat model for attacks on data attribution in a data compensation scenario.

Perturbs data to decrease the model's confidence in its prediction. *Importantly, only perturbs the input feature (x) and not the label (y).* This makes the outliers more subtle and harder to detect.\n        *   *Image Classification*\n            *   *How it works:* Data points are perturbed by maximizing the loss through black-box attack methods designed to generate adversarial examples.\n            *   *Methods used:*\n                *   Zeroth Order Optimization (ZOO) (Chen et al., 2017): This method is used for smaller-scale image classification settings.\n                *   Simba (Guo et al., 2019): This method is used for larger-scale image classification settings, as it is more computationally efficient.\n        *   *Theoretical Justification:* Theorem 5.1 (Informal) states that the effect of adversarial attacks on the original model can successfully translate to the new model.\n\n4.  **Experimental Results:**\n\n    *   **Image Classification Tasks:** (MNIST, Digits, CIFAR-10)\n    *   **Shadow Attack:**\n        *   Can inflate compensation by 200% to 456%.\n        *   Effective even when shadow models have a slightly different architecture than the target model.\n    *   **Outlier Attack:**\n        *   Can inflate compensation by 185% to 643%.\n        *   Uses black-box adversarial attack methods like ZOO and Simba.\n        *   TextFooler (Jin et al., 2020) method is used to generate adversarial examples.\n\n5. **Reference to recent works:**\n\n*   (Deng & Ma, 2023; Wang et al., 2024) explored economic frameworks using data attribution for copyright compensation.\n*   (Just et al., 2023; Wang & Jia, 2023; Kwon & Zou, 2023) Data attribution methods have been widely used for quantifying the value of training data in AI applications and compensating data providers\n*   (Park et al., 2023) Introduced TRAK: Attributing model behavior at scale.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions (Implied):**\n\n*   The paper highlights the adversarial vulnerability of data attribution, which is crucial for building trustworthy AI systems.\n*   The findings indicate a need for developing more *robust data attribution methods*.  The paper's analysis of attack strategies (especially the Outlier Attack) provides insights into the vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.\n\n**Why This Matters for Adversarial Robustness (Image Classification):**\n\n*   **Indirect Defense Implications:** While not a direct defense paper, this work *highlights vulnerabilities* that defenses *should* address. If data valuation is susceptible to adversarial manipulation, this is a weakness in the overall AI ecosystem.\n*   **Real-World Relevance:**  The attacks are designed to be realistic (small perturbations, no synthetic data), making the findings more concerning for practical applications.\n*   **Focus on Black-Box Attacks:** The Outlier Attack is particularly important because it demonstrates that effective attacks are possible *without* white-box access to the model. This is a more realistic threat model in many scenarios.\n* **Novelty:** The work presented is the first comprehensive study to address the adversarial attacks on data attribution methods.\n\nIn summary, this paper doesn't present a novel defense *mechanism*. However, its detailed analysis of adversarial *vulnerabilities* in data attribution, particularly using black-box outlier attacks, makes it a valuable contribution to the broader field of adversarial robustness in image classification. The references to black box attacks are highly relevant. The paper is also current, as the publication date is within the last 2 years."

      "relevancy": "This paper addresses transferable adversarial robustness for categorical data via universal robust embeddings, which is relevant to the broader topic of adversarial robustness, even if it focuses on categorical rather than image data.  The paper is from 2023.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper's content, focusing on information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper (and Why It's *Not* Directly About Image Classification)**\n\nThis paper is primarily concerned with *adversarial robustness for categorical data*, specifically in the context of *tabular data*.  This is a *different* domain than image classification, which is traditionally the focus of adversarial robustness research.  The authors explicitly state that most adversarial machine learning research focuses on images and text.  Therefore, while it might contain *indirectly* relevant information about trends in adversarial robustness *in general*, it's not directly addressing the research question as framed.  The paper itself *mentions* image classification work as a point of contrast (i.e., how tabular data robustness *differs*).\n\n**Why the Paper is Still Worth Analyzing (Even if It's Not Image-Specific)**\n\nEven though this paper doesn't focus on images, it *does* highlight several trends and challenges in adversarial robustness that are *potentially transferable or conceptually relevant* to the image domain, or at least illustrate broader themes in the field.  It also cites papers that *do* focus on image robustness. The paper also presents new methods that are innovative in the general topic of adversarial robustness.\n\n**Extracted Information Relevant to General Trends (With Timestamps!)**\n\nHere's what can be gleaned from the paper that *might* be relevant to the broader trends in adversarial robustness, even if not directly about images:\n\n1.  **Shift from \u2113p-Norm Bounded Perturbations to More Realistic Threat Models (Addresses a Shortcoming in Image Research):**\n\n    *   **Trend:** A move away from the standard \u2113p-norm bounded perturbations (the *de facto* standard, Croce et al., 2020 - cited in paper). \u2113p norms are common in image research.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The authors argue that \u2113p-norm based robustness evaluation doesn't accurately represent real-world adversaries, especially outside the image domain (Kireev et al., 2022; Apruzzese et al., 2022).\n    *   **Alternative Model:**  Instead, a realistic threat model should constrain the adversary with respect to their financial capabilities, associating a financial cost with every input feature transformation.  This connects security/robustness to real-world limitations.  This is crucial for tabular data, but the *concept* of moving beyond simple pixel-level perturbations to cost-aware attacks *could* have implications for image research as well (e.g., considering the cost of manipulating objects in an image).\n    *   **Relevance to Image Domain:** Even though the \"financial cost\" doesn't directly apply, the *underlying trend* is about creating more realistic and relevant threat models, which could influence image-based research (e.g., semantic perturbations).\n\n2.  **Importance of Cost-Sensitive Robustness (Generalization of the Threat Model):**\n\n    *   **Trend:** Considering cost-sensitive robustness formulations (Zhang & Evans, 2019; Shen et al., 2022).\n    *   **Reasoning:**  Adversaries are typically interested only in specific class changes (e.g., fraudulent to non-fraudulent). Standard benchmarks treat all class changes equally. Assigning unequal costs to different class changes leads to a better robustness-accuracy tradeoff against a cost-sensitive adversary.\n     *  **Relevance to Image Domain:** This principle can be adapted to image classification by considering the costs of changing one object to another in an image.\n\n3.  **Adversarial Training as a Key Defense (But with Challenges):**\n\n    *   **Trend:** Adversarial training remains the key algorithm for making neural networks robust (Madry et al., 2018).\n    *   **Challenges:** The paper notes challenges in applying adversarial training to non-differentiable models (like decision trees) and to discrete/categorical data.\n    *   **Specific Techniques Mentioned:** Projected gradient descent (PGD) is a common method for crafting adversarial examples and is used within adversarial training.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Domain:** Reinforces that adversarial training is a continued trend, but highlights the need to adapt it to different architectures and data types, so the specific techniques may not transfer directly but the general idea remains relevant.\n\n4.  **Robust Embeddings for Transfer Learning:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** Using robust embeddings as a way to transfer robustness from one model to another (specifically, from neural networks to tree-based models in this paper).  Yang et al. (2022) and Dong et al. (2021) are cited as using robust word embeddings.\n    *   **Innovation:** Proposes a bilevel alternating minimization framework to generate universal robust embeddings.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Domain:** Transfer learning is a huge area. The concept of creating robust embeddings could potentially be applied in the image domain to transfer robustness between different architectures or datasets.\n\n5.  **Importance of Benchmarks:**\n\n    *   **Issue:** Lack of well-motivated benchmarks for robustness research on tabular data.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Domain:** Benchmarks are also a big theme in the image domain, this reinforces the need for strong benchmarks in general.\n\n**Papers Cited (Within the Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe following cited papers fall within the \"last 2 years\" (2022-2024):\n\n*   Apruzzese et al. (2022):  Discusses the gap between adversarial ML research and practice, arguing that \"real attackers don't compute gradients.\"  *Implication: Calls for more realistic threat models*.\n*   Bakiskan et al.

However, it highlights the general trends in adversarial machine learning, with the need for better threat models, the use of adversarial training and robust embeddings."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Strategy of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper \"Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Machine Learning-Powered Networks: A Contemporary Survey\" presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in adversarial attack and defense techniques, focusing on deep neural network-based classification models, with an emphasis on DNN-based image classification models. It is structured to categorize attack methods and defense techniques, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight new attack avenues and defense methods, summarizing the latest insights and future research directions.\n\n**Explicit Statements on Timeframe:**\n\n*   The survey focuses on advancements \"over the last 24 months\" (meaning the last 2 years).\n*   It includes \"over 180 quality research papers published in IEEE and ACM journals and top conferences, such as CVPR, ICCV, and AAAI, *since 2021*.\"  This is a critical confirmation that the paper explicitly aims to cover the period relevant to the research question.\n*   The paper claims to cover the large number of papers published in this field in 2021 and 2022:  \"For example, in the Year 2022 alone, over 1,200 research articles were published on adversarial attacks and defenses, documenting many new attack and defense techniques, and incidents. In the Year 2021, over 1,000 research articles were published on these topics.\"\n\n**Key Areas of Investigation for Adversarial Robustness Trends:**\n\nThe paper's structure and content imply that the following areas are central to understanding current trends in adversarial robustness for image classification:\n\n1.  **Adversarial Attack Detection and Data Preprocessing:**  How to identify adversarial samples *before* they impact the classification model.  This is a first line of defense approach.\n2.  **Robustness Enhancement for Deep Learning Models:**  Modifying the DNN itself to be inherently more resistant to adversarial attacks.  This is considered a more proactive approach.\n3.  **Specific Attack Methodologies (as they relate to defenses):** Understanding the *types* of attacks that defenses are trying to thwart is crucial.  The paper categorizes these as:\n    *   Gradient-Based Attacks\n    *   Constrained Optimization-Based Attacks\n    *   Gradient-Free (Heuristic) Attacks\n    *   Adversarial Patch Attacks (especially relevant to real-world scenarios)\n4.  **Transferability:**  A recurring theme is the \"transferability\" of attacks. If an attack crafted for one model can fool others, it highlights a general vulnerability. Likewise, defenses should ideally be robust to transferable attacks.\n\n**Detailed Extraction of Relevant Trends (Organized by the paper's main sections):**\n\n***\n\n**IV. STATE-OF-THE-ART ADVERSARIAL DEFENSE TECHNIQUES**\n\n*   **A. Overview**\n\n    *   Typical adversarial defense techniques that have been developed include:\n        *   Adversarial Learning\n        *   Monitoring\n        *   Model Robustness Design\n        *   Adversarial Perturbation Structure Destruction\n*   **B. Adversarial Attack Detection and Data Preprocessing**\n\n    *   Adversarial Attack Detection:\n        *   An algorithm called RObust SAliency (ROSA), is an innovative technique for enhancing the robustness of FCN-based salient object recognition models against adversarial attacks.\n        *   Cascade model-aware generative (CMAG) is an adversarial sample detection technique that provides a new means to detect the presence of adversarial samples, which can accurately detect high-quality adversarial samples.\n        *   Zhang et al. [185] presented a step-based deep learning network known as ADNet. ADNet is a DNN model for adversarial example detection by using steganalysis and attention mechanisms.\n        *   A new approach named UnMask is proposed, which is a framework for detection and protection against adversaries that relies on strong feature alignment.\n        *   Wang et al. [187] Developed Model-independent methods to detect adversarial inputs. As the primary architecture of the detector, an LSTM network is trained to capture variations in the logit sequence distribution.\n        *   To detect arbitrary adversarial attacks without access to reference spectrographs and adversarial perturbations, Esmaeilpour et al. [188] propose a regularized logistic regression model to distinguish the eigenvalues of malicious spectral graphs from legitimate spectral graphs.\n        *   In response to the adversarial attacks in the realm of radio signals, Xu et al. [37] describe a novel adversarial sample identification method by means of the integration of many features. They also provide a framework for creating adversarial samples, collecting local intrinsic dimension (LID) characteristics and constellation diagram (CD) characteristics, and recognizing adversarial samples.\n\n    *   Data Preprocessing:\n\n        *   Kang et al. [194] propose a purification model named CAP-GAN (Cycle-consistent attentional purification GAN), aimed at decreasing the impact of adversarial perturbations by transforming the input.\n        *   Zhou _et al. [196] suggest a self-supervised adversarial training_ mechanism in the class activation feature space to eliminate adversarial noise.\n        *   With the aim of addressing both adversarial examples deliberately created to cause harm and inputs that fall outside of the expected distribution, Wei et al. [198] develop XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification technique.\n        *   Zhu et al. [202] examine adversarial training from the standpoint of data-to-decision boundary distance. They introduce Saliency Adversarial Defense (SAD).\n        *   Mustafa _et al. [203] put forth an image restoration approach by using_ super-resolution, which projects off-the-manifold adversarial instances into the native image manifold.\n        *   Yan et al. [166] develop the Dual-Domain based Defense (D2Defend), which recovers both low and high-frequency picture structures in the spatial and transform domains, while eliminating adversary distortions.\n\n*   **C. Robustness Enhancement for Deep Learning Models**\n\n    *   Regularization on Input Layer:\n        *   Yan et al. [210] provide Adversarial Margin Maximization (AMM) as a learning-based regularization, which substitutes an adversarial perturbation for the geometric margin.\n        *   Yang et al. [211] present a transformation-aware adversarial face generation strategy to increase the defense capability against GAN-based DeepFake variants in the black-box situation.\n        *   Yu et al. [212] propose Progressive Diversified Augmentation (PDA), which increases the resilience of DNNs by gradually infusing different adversarial sounds in the training phase.\n        *   Chen et al. [123] propose adversarial Meta Reinforcement Learning (adMRL) to generate adversarial attack instances by using an adversarial GAN (adGAN) and leverage the generated examples to enhance the Meta Reinforcement Learning (MRL) algorithm\u2019s robustness\n        *   In their study, Kundu et al. [213] present a spike-timing-dependent back-propagation (STDB)-based SNN training method to better leverage the inherent robustness of SNNs.\n        *   According to [214], the principal consequence of adversarial attacks is the modification of the prediction distribution. On the basis of this, they suggest Induced Class Adversarial Training (ICAT), a simple but successful strategy that incorporates an extra-induced class to defend against adversarial examples.\n        *   Yao et al. [215] target at classification and proposed Adaptive Retraining (ART) for neural networks, which implicitly improves a model\u2019s capacity in maximizing the minimal distance from data instances of all classes to the decision border.\n        *   Gong et al. [216] present MaxUp, a simple yet effective method for enhancing generalization and minimizing overfitting.\n        *   Liu _et al. [217], which learns stable and durable node embeddings_ with three players. A basic producer collects features for node pairings, a dynamic seller selects negative samples, and a biased consumer perturbs the objective function, all at the same time measuring the performance of node embeddings.\n        *   Poursaeed et al. [218] propose Generative Adversarial Training (GAT) to boost the model\u2019s generalization ability to test sets and out-of-domain data, and its resilience against unanticipated adversarial attacks.\n        *   Hong et al. [219] claim that properly blending the content and style of two input images can result in more numerous and robust samples, which enhances model generalization during training.\n        *   Feng et al. [178] propose a dynamic regularization scheme called graph adversarial training (GraphAT).\n        *   Shen et al. [221] suggest a novel method for safeguarding a particular class from adversarial attacks, which is different from previous defensive approaches that try to increase the resilience of overall classes.\n        *   In view of human outstanding generalization ability Chen _et al. [222] argue that a resilient CNN should be able to_ endure changes in amplitude while concentrating on the phase spectrum.\n        *   Sun et al. [223] are particularly interested in shape features and propose two edge-enabled pipelines, namely, EdgeNetRob and EdgeGANRob, to force CNNs to rely more on edge features, inspired by the fact that the visual system of humans ends up paying more attention on global features, such as shapes, for recognition, whereas CNN models are biased towards local features (e.g., textures) in images.\n    *   Regularization on Middle Layer:\n        *   Adversarial Noise Propagation (ANP) [224] is a simple yet strong training technique that, unlike classic adversarial defensive methods, does not manipulate solely the input layer (as discussed in Section IV-C1).\n        *   Zhang et al. [225] provide a unique perspective of neuron sensitivity to explain adversarial resilience for deep models, as assessed by the magnitude of variance in neuronal activity in response to benign and adversarial situations. They suggest a Sensitive Neuron Stabilizing (SNS) approach after analyzing the behaviors of the model\u2019s intermediate layers and demonstrating dependence between adversarial resilience and neuron sensitivities.\n        *   Yao et al. [15] offer a defensive model that makes use of a supervision method to enhance the model\u2019s robustness. The assumption is that supervision can increase the quality of feature maps for the hidden layer, hence increasing the resilience of the model.\n        *   Schwartz et al. [226] propose a method called HLDR to improve adversarial robustness by using latent disparity regularization. The regularizer is defined to depend linearly on the disparity in representations created in the hidden layers based on benign and adversarial data.\n        *   Dual Head Adversarial Training (DH-AT) [227] is a novel defensive method that employs a dual-headed architecture to increase both clean accuracy and adversarial resilience as an enhanced form of Adversarial Training (AT) in both network structure and training strategy.\n        *   Li et al. [228] propose an Embedding Regularized Classifier (ER Classifier) to improve the adversarial resilience of classifiers. The intrinsic dimension of image data is substantially less than its pixel space dimension, and hostile examples often dwell outside the manifold of natural image data.\n        *   Similarly Carbone et al [229] propose RP Ensemble a training approach based on the Manifold Hypothesis [230], [231].\n        *   CNNs usually ignore key auxiliary properties, whilst current adversarial training and regularization approaches overlook the independence of local features. Liu et al. [232] introduce TENET Training, a group-wise inhibition-based regularization approach for enhancing feature diversity and network resilience.\n        *   While classifying hyperspectral pictures, a novel self-attention context network (SACNet) [233] is presented to strengthen the network\u2019s inherent resilience to adversarial samples.\n        *   According to [234], the downsampling method is primarily responsible for CNNs\u2019 poor noise resilience. They combine frequently employed CNN designs with a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to produce wavelet-integrated convolutional networks (WaveCNets), which address the issue of aliasing in CNNs and enhance noise resistance in image classification.\n        *   Yu et al. [154] show that universal adversarial patches in prevalent CNNs often generate deep feature vectors that have very large norms. They suggest a simple but effective defensive technique based on a unique feature norm clipping (FNC) layer.\n        *   Mok et al. [235] investigate the topic of constructing an adversarially resilient neural network with strong inherent resilience and robust training strategies. Adversarially Robust Architecture Rush (AdvRush) is an adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture search (NAS) approach based on the observation that the inherent robustness of a neural network depends on the smoothness of its input landscape regardless of the training procedure.\n        *   Yeo et al. [236] present a general framework for developing robust predictions based on the creation of a varied ensemble of different middle domains.\n        *   To mitigate the sensitivity of the output to changes in the input, Amini et al. [179] offer a new non-smooth regularization term in the optimization formulation and two non-smooth regularizers that construct direct linkages for the weight matrices in each neural network layer.\n        *   Therefore, Serrurier et al. [238] provide a novel optimal transport-based classification framework that takes into account the Lipschitz constant and the gradient norm preservation requirement. They use a regularized Kantorovich-Rubinstein formulation that includes a hinge loss term, which provides the desired robustness guarantees with little accuracy loss.\n        *   Some defensive approaches augment the standard training aim for intermediate layers with graduated penalties.\n    *   Regularization on Output Layer:\n        *   Many recent works enhance the resilience of a student network with a teacher network by using Knowledge distillation (KD) [240] in combination with adversarial training.\n        *   To solve this issue, Zi et al. [165] propose Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD), a unique method for training small, robust student models by distilling from adversarially trained large models.\n        *   Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML) is a new adversarial trainingbased model proposed by Wang et al. [241]. By leveraging knowledge distillation, the approach is made up of two parts: Bidirectional attack metric learning (BML) and attentionguided knowledge distillation (AGKD).\n        *   Mustafa et al. [248] explain the proximity of distinct classes of samples in the learned feature space of deep learning models is the primary reason for the vulnerabilities in DNNs. As a proactive protection against adversarial attacks, they suggest a distance-based training technique, Prototype Conformity Loss (PCL), to solve this issue.\n        *   Bernhard et al. [164] create an innovative technique known as the \u201cluring effect\u201d to prevent transferability between two models to pave a new path for robustness in a realistic blackbox situation.\n        *   Like conventional method for improving adversarial resilience by limiting logit norms to tiny values [249], Kanai _et al. [250] introduce a function named bounded logit function (BLF), which employs a bounded activation function shortly before the softmax to confine the logit norms._\n        *   Liu et al. [251] concentrate on constructing certifiers to identify certified areas of the input neighborhood where the model produces the right prediction and employing such certifiers to train a model to be verifiably resilient to adversarial attacks.\n\n    *   Regularization Across Layers \u2013 Gradient Masking:\n        *   Gradient masking here refers to a typical approach for protecting against white-box attacks that depend on model gradients.\n\n**V. LESSONS LEARNED AND OPEN ISSUES**\n\n*   In this section, the paper summarizes the key trade-offs and challenges in both attack and defense strategies. These are crucial for understanding the direction of future research.\n*   **Adversarial Attacks**\n    *   \"It is important to strike a balance between effectiveness, imperceptibility, complexity, and transferability in adversarial attacks, among which there are obvious trade-offs.\"\n*   **Adversarial Defenses**\n    *   \u201cTrade-off between Defense Effectiveness and Overhead:\n    *   There is clearly a trade-off between defense effectiveness and defense overhead, e.g., training time and/or complexity.\u201d\n    *   \u201cScalability and Generalizability:\n    *   It is generally hard to apply a defense method that is effective on one DNN model or dataset, to other complex DNN models or datasets.\u201d\n    *   \u201cDependence on Data: Adversarial sample detection has traditionally relied on data-driven methods. However, there is a lack of agreement on the mathematical definition of adversarial samples limiting current research in this field \u201c\n\n***\n\n**In summary, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, according to this survey of papers published since 2021, involve:**\n\n1.  **Increased Sophistication in Adversarial Training:**  Adversarial training remains a core defense, but newer methods focus on:\n    *   Generating more diverse and realistic adversarial examples (e.g., using GANs, StyleMix).\n    *   Adaptive methods that adjust the training process based on the specific model and threat environment.\n    *   Exploiting meta-learning to improve generalization in the face of new attacks.\n    *   Using a student/teacher model.\n2.  **Focus on Transferability:** Both in crafting attacks *and* in evaluating defenses.  Defenses need to be robust against attacks transferred from other models or datasets.\n3.  **Attention Mechanisms:**  Incorporating attention mechanisms into both attacks (to target vulnerable areas) and defenses (to focus on relevant features) is a trend.\n4.  **Provable Robustness:** While challenging, there's a push for defense methods with *guaranteed* robustness, rather than just empirical results.\n5.  **Data Preprocessing Methods:** Developing robust data preprocessing techniques to eliminate adversarial noise.\n\n**Caveats:**\n\n*   The survey itself is limited by the papers it *chose* to include.  It may not be a perfectly comprehensive representation of *all* research in the area.\n*   \"Latest\" is a moving target.  Given the rapid pace of this field, even a survey from \"the last 2 years\" may not be completely up-to-date.\n\nThis detailed extraction should provide a solid foundation for understanding current trends in adversarial robustness."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down the information from this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information:\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on **adversarial example *detection***, not strictly on adversarial robustness *techniques* in general. It proposes a novel method for *detecting* adversarial attacks, aiming to identify malicious inputs before they can fool an image classification model.\n\n**Key Findings and Contributions (Relevant to Robustness Trends):**\n\n1.  **Detection as a Defense Mechanism:** The paper implicitly highlights a significant trend: *adversarial detection as a critical component of overall robustness*.  It acknowledges that current detection methods are lagging behind attack methods and proposes a more effective detection technique. By accurately detecting adversarial examples, one can then prevent their misclassification, effectively \"robustifying\" the system.\n\n2.  **Sentiment Analysis Approach:** A core trend highlighted is using **natural language processing techniques (specifically sentiment analysis) for image-based adversarial defense.** The paper details:\n    *   Transforming hidden-layer feature maps of a DNN into word vectors (a \"sentence\").\n    *   Analyzing the \"sentiment\" of this sentence to determine if an adversarial perturbation is present (positive sentiment = adversarial, negative sentiment = benign).\n    *   Using TextCNN (a sentiment analysis model) for this classification, citing its simplicity and accuracy.\n    *   This leverages the idea that adversarial perturbations progressively manifest in the hidden layers, mimicking sentiment changes in a sentence.\n\n3.  **Modular Embedding Layer:** The paper's proposed modular embedding layer addresses the issue of differently sized feature maps. This is a practical engineering contribution that enables the sentiment analysis approach to be applied effectively. It resizes and embeds hidden-layer feature maps into equal-length word vectors, using a modular design with minimal learnable parameters.\n\n4.  **Superior Performance Against Latest Attacks:**  The paper emphasizes that its detector *outperforms state-of-the-art detection algorithms* against recent and powerful attacks. The attacks used for evaluation include AutoAttack, DeepFool, and EAD. This is a crucial claim indicating advancement beyond existing robustness techniques. Datasets used: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN.\n\n5.  **Emphasis on Complex Attacks:** The paper directly states that existing detectors are less effective against \"mighty attacks\" like DeepFool and EAD.  This points to a trend where adversarial research is moving beyond simple attacks (like FGSM) to more sophisticated and harder-to-detect methods, and robustness techniques must adapt accordingly.\n\n6.  **Computational Efficiency:** The detector is designed to be lightweight (approximately 2 million parameters) and fast (detecting adversarial examples in under 4.6 milliseconds using a Tesla K80 GPU).  This is important for real-world deployment, indicating a trend towards practical and efficient robustness solutions.\n\n7.  **White-Box Attack Resistance:** The paper acknowledges the possibility of attackers accessing the detector's gradients. Their findings suggest that their proposed detector is effective in resisting such white-box attacks, especially after being retrained on new adversarial examples.\n\n**Specific Attack and Defense Methods Mentioned (with Citations, Important for Identifying Trends):**\n\n*   **Attacks:**\n    *   FGSM \\[11]\n    *   Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) \\[2]\n    *   DeepFool \\[13]\n    *   Carlini & Wagner (C&W) \\[17]\n    *   Elastic-Net Attacks on DNNs (EAD) \\[14]\n    *   Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) \\[12]\n    *   AutoAttack \\[15] (includes Auto-PGD, FAB Attack \\[19], and Square Attack \\[20])\n\n*   **Existing Detectors (Benchmarks):**\n    *   Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) \\[5]\n    *   Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN) \\[6]\n    *   Nearest Neighbor Influence Functions (NNIF) \\[7]\n    *   Mahalanobis distance-based algorithm \\[8]\n    *   Be Your Own Neighborhood (BEYOND) \\[9]\n    *   Positive-Negative Detector (PNDetector) \\[10]\n\n**Important Details from the Experiment Section:**\n\n*   **Image Classifiers Used:** ResNet-34 \\[22], Inception-V3\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN\n*   **Performance Metric:** Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Detection vs. General Robustness:** This paper focuses *specifically* on *detecting* adversarial examples.  While detection contributes to robustness, it's not the same as making a model inherently resistant to adversarial perturbations.\n*   **Black-Box Threat Model Assumption:** The threat model primarily assumes the detector is a black box to the attacker. While the white-box defense is considered, the main defense relies on this assumption.\n*   **CIFAR-100 Performance:** The detector's performance is generally better on CIFAR-10 and SVHN than CIFAR-100.\n\n**In summary, based on the provided paper (published within the last 2 years), the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification include:**\n\n*   **Adversarial detection is a critical defense layer**: Developing methods for detecting adversarial examples is a practical and increasingly important area of research.\n*   **Leveraging NLP techniques for Image Adversarial Defense**: Employing techniques from natural language processing, particularly sentiment analysis, for image-based adversarial defense.\n*   **Focus on Sophisticated Attacks:** Addressing more complex and stealthy attacks like DeepFool and EAD is crucial.\n*   **Efficiency and Practicality:** Designing detectors that are computationally efficient and can be deployed in real-world applications is key."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**Relevant Information:**\n\n*   **Focus on Semantic Segmentation:**  The paper *primarily* addresses adversarial robustness in *semantic segmentation*, not image classification. However, it leverages advancements in robust ImageNet classifiers (which *are* image classification models) to improve semantic segmentation robustness. This connection makes the paper somewhat relevant.\n\n*   **PIR-AT: Leveraging Robust ImageNet Backbones:** The most significant trend discussed is the use of \"Pre-trained ImageNet Robust AT (PIR-AT).\"  This involves:\n\n    *   **Initialization:** Initializing the *backbone* of the segmentation model with a pre-trained, adversarially robust ImageNet classifier (specifically, \u2113\u221e-robust classifiers).\n    *   **Reduced Training Cost:**  This drastically reduces the cost of adversarial training (AT) for semantic segmentation. Robust ImageNet classifiers are readily available (e.g., in RobustBench), eliminating the need to train them from scratch within the segmentation training loop.\n    *   **State-of-the-Art Robustness:** PIR-AT achieves state-of-the-art robustness on segmentation datasets (Pascal-Voc, Ade20K).\n    *   **Performance:** Demonstrates significant improvements in robust average pixel accuracy and mIoU compared to other methods like DDC-AT.  For instance, on Pascal-Voc, PIR-AT attains 71.7% robust accuracy at \u03f5\u221e = 8/255, compared to 0.0% of DDC-AT, with negligible drop in clean performance.  It also achieves the first robust models on the more challenging Ade20K dataset, with up to 55.5% robust accuracy at \u03f5\u221e = 4/255.\n    *   **Generalizability:** PIR-AT consistently outperforms standard AT across different segmentation networks (PSPNet, UPerNet, Segmenter).\n    *   **Efficiency:** PIR-AT is shown to be significantly faster to train than standard adversarial training methods, achieving better robustness with fewer epochs.\n\n*   **Challenges in Semantic Segmentation Robustness:** The paper highlights why adversarial training is much harder for semantic segmentation than image classification:\n\n    *   **Attack Difficulty:**  Attacking semantic segmentation models is more difficult because the attacker needs to flip the predictions of *all* pixels, not just the overall image prediction.\n    *   **Cross-Entropy Loss Limitations:**  The cross-entropy loss, commonly used in image classification attacks, is not a suitable objective for generating strong adversarial attacks against semantic segmentation models. This is because the gradients are largest for already misclassified pixels, hindering the ability to flip correctly classified pixels.\n\n*   **Novel Attack Strategies for Semantic Segmentation (SEA):**  To address the evaluation of adversarial robustness in semantic segmentation, the paper introduces several novel attack strategies:\n\n    *   **Jensen-Shannon (JS) Divergence Loss:**  A loss function that is bounded and down-weights contributions from misclassified pixels, allowing for simultaneous optimization of all pixels.\n    *   **Masked Cross-Entropy (MCE) Loss (Unbalanced and Balanced):** Applying a mask to the cross-entropy loss to exclude misclassified pixels. This helps to focus on correctly classified pixels. MCE-Bal is designed to optimize the mIoU metric.\n    *   **Segmentation Ensemble Attack (SEA):**  An ensemble of the JS divergence, Masked Cross-Entropy (MCE), and balanced Masked Cross-Entropy (MCE-Bal) losses. This ensemble provides a more reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness because the individual attacks are complementary. SEA outperforms existing state-of-the-art attacks (SegPGD, CosPGD).\n    *   **Optimization Techniques:** Introduces progressive radius reduction for the PGD attack, which proves to be more effective than standard PGD optimization schemes.\n\n*   **Limitations of the Study:** Acknowledges the lack of a black-box attack within the SEA framework, and the fact that SEA could overestimate robustness for defenses exploiting gradient masking.\n\n**Trends in Image Classification (as leveraged in the paper):**\n\nWhile the primary focus is semantic segmentation, the paper implicitly leverages trends in *image classification* robustness by using robust ImageNet classifiers. These trends include:\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** Training models to be robust against adversarial examples.\n*   **\u2113\u221e-Robustness:** Focus on robustness against \u2113\u221e-bounded perturbations.\n*   **Robust Pre-trained Models:** The increasing availability of robust pre-trained models on ImageNet (e.g., using architectures like ConvNeXt)\n\n**In summary:** The paper showcases a trend of leveraging robust image classification backbones (specifically, ImageNet pre-trained models) to improve the adversarial robustness of semantic segmentation models. It also presents novel attack strategies to reliably evaluate the robustness of semantic segmentation models, highlighting challenges specific to this task."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information addressing the research question:\n\n**Research Question:** What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**Relevant Information from the Paper:**\n\nThis paper, published recently, explores adversarial robustness trends focusing specifically on Vision Transformers (ViTs) compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the last two years. The paper investigates this by:\n\n1.  **Examining Frequency-Selective Attacks:** A significant trend highlighted is the shift from solely spatial-domain attacks to exploring adversarial robustness in the spectral domain (frequency domain). The authors formulate an attack framework capable of perturbing images in both spatial and spectral domains (magnitude and phase spectra) to analyze the vulnerability of models to frequency-selective attacks.\n2.  **Conflicting Conclusions Regarding ViT Robustness:** The paper acknowledges that previous research comparing the adversarial robustness of CNNs and Transformers present conflicting conclusions. Some studies suggest ViTs are *more* robust than CNNs to gradient-based attacks, attributing this to CNNs relying on high-frequency information while ViTs rely on low-frequency information. Other studies claim similar levels of robustness between the two architectures. This paper tries to provide a new perspective.\n3.  **Attack Strength Consideration:** The paper emphasizes the importance of considering a wide range of attack strengths when evaluating model robustness. The authors found that the relative vulnerability between models can change depending on the intensity of the attack.\n4.  **Key Findings on ViT Vulnerability:** The paper presents experimental results demonstrating that ViTs are *particularly vulnerable* to perturbations in the *magnitude and phase components* of the frequency domain, especially phase perturbations concentrated in the low-frequency region. This suggests that ViTs, despite some claims of greater robustness, can be exploited through frequency-specific attacks.\n5.  **Linearity and Model Vulnerability:** The authors analyze the vulnerability of ViTs to phase attacks from the perspective of model linearity. They suggest that ViTs, which can be more linear than CNNs in certain aspects, are more susceptible to phase attacks because these attacks can more effectively manipulate features in the adversarial direction.\n6.  **Importance of Phase Information:** The paper emphasizes the importance of phase information for image classification, especially for transformers. By corrupting either magnitude or phase information from images, the authors demonstrated that classification accuracy is more sensitive to phase reduction than magnitude reduction. They also demonstrated that transformers rely more on phase information than CNNs.\n\n**Specific Trends and Insights from the Related Works section:**\n\n*   **Conflicting Views (2021-2023):**  The paper explicitly acknowledges the differing viewpoints regarding the robustness of ViTs compared to CNNs, supported by recent publications:\n    *   **ViTs More Robust:**  References \\[4], \\[5], \\[6], \\[28] (published in 2021 and 2022) suggest ViTs are more robust due to CNNs' reliance on high-frequency information, making CNNs more vulnerable to common gradient-based attacks. Reference \\[29] (published in 2022) attribute the higher robustness to the severe nonlinearity of the input-output relationship of Transformers. Reference \\[30] (published in 2023) recognized that ViTs exhibit more robust generalization when adversarial training is considered.\n    *   **Similar Robustness:** References \\[7], \\[8], \\[9] (published in 2021) claim ViTs and CNNs have similar adversarial robustness.\n*   **Patch-Based Attacks (2022):** References \\[31], \\[32], \\[33] (published in 2022) explore patch-based attacks, where localized perturbations on image patches can effectively fool ViTs due to their patch-wise self-attention mechanism.\n\n**Why this paper is relevant to the research question:**\n\n*   **Addresses Recent Research (2021-2023):** The paper focuses on recent developments in adversarial robustness, citing numerous publications within the last two years.\n*   **Focuses on ViTs:** It directly investigates the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers, a key architecture in modern image classification.\n*   **Explores Novel Attack Vectors:** The research moves beyond traditional spatial-domain attacks by exploring frequency-selective perturbations, offering a fresh perspective on ViT vulnerabilities.\n*   **Contributes to the Debate:** The paper provides evidence that challenges the notion that ViTs are inherently more robust than CNNs, adding to the ongoing discussion and highlighting specific weaknesses of ViTs.\n\nIn summary, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, as evidenced by this paper, include a deeper investigation of Vision Transformer vulnerabilities, a shift towards frequency-domain attacks, and an ongoing debate regarding the relative robustness of ViTs compared to CNNs. The paper highlights that ViTs are susceptible to attacks targeting specific frequency components, particularly the phase information in the low-frequency region, and the importance of considering attack strength when comparing model robustness."

      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided research paper and extracted the information most relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the paper's content, focusing on the trends it identifies:\n\n**Overall Trend: Initialization Matters Significantly in Adversarial Robustness for Transfer Learning**\n\nThe core finding of this paper, and thus a major trend it highlights, is the *critical role of initialization* in achieving adversarial robustness in image classification, *especially within the transfer learning paradigm*.  This breaks down into the following components:\n\n1.  **Necessity of a Robust Pretrained Model:** The paper emphasizes that starting with an adversarially robust *pretrained* model is crucial. Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods fail or perform poorly when initialized with a *standard* (non-robust) pretrained model, even with adversarial training during finetuning.  This signifies a shift towards leveraging robust pretraining as a foundation.\n\n2.  **Importance of Linear Head Initialization:** The research introduces \"Robust Linear Initialization (RoLI),\" which initializes the linear head (the part that adapts the pretrained features to the downstream task) with weights obtained from *adversarial linear probing*.  This method *maximizes the inheritance of robustness from the pretrained model*. This is a trend toward more carefully designed initialization strategies.\n\n3.  **RoLI Achieves SOTA Results:**  The paper demonstrates that RoLI, combined with adversarial finetuning, achieves new state-of-the-art results across five image classification datasets, suggesting that proper initialization is a critical piece of the puzzle for improved adversarial robustness.\n\n**Specific Trends and Techniques Discussed:**\n\n*   **Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) Methods:** The paper explores various PEFT methods like Adapter, LoRA, Bias, and VPT, and how their adversarial robustness is affected by initialization. This highlights the trend of using PEFT to reduce computational costs and prevent overfitting while maintaining (or improving) robustness. The paper studies six popular finetuning techniques (Full Finetune, Adapter, LoRA, Bias, VPT, and Linear Probing).\n\n*   **Adversarial Linear Probing:** The study discovers that adversarial linear probing (finetuning *only* the classification head) can outperform other methods on certain datasets *when starting with a robust pretrained model*. This is because it excels at *preserving* the robustness from pretraining.\n\n*   **Robust Pretraining vs. Large-Scale Pretraining:** The paper demonstrates that using a *smaller*, but *robust*, pretrained model is more effective for achieving adversarial robustness in downstream tasks than using a *larger*, but *non-robust*, pretrained model (like CLIP).\n\n*   **Dual Batch Normalization (TWINS) and Automated Robust Fine-Tuning (AutoLoRA):** Mentions existing techniques such as TWINS-AT (which incorporates dual batch normalization to keep the statistics of pretrained and finetuned datasets separate) and AutoLoRA (which introduces a low-rank branch to disentangle clean and adversarial objectives). These represent prior attempts to preserve robustness during finetuning and are used as baselines in the paper's experiments.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** The paper uses adversarial training (specifically PGD - Projected Gradient Descent) during finetuning as a standard technique to improve robustness.\n\n**Datasets and Evaluation Metrics:**\n\n*   The paper uses common image classification datasets like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech256, CUB200 (Caltech-UCSD Birds), and Stanford Dogs.\n\n*   Evaluation metrics include:\n    *   **Clean Accuracy:** Accuracy on original, unperturbed images.\n    *   **Robust Accuracy:** Accuracy under adversarial attacks (PGD and AutoAttack).\n    *   **AutoAttack (AA):** An ensemble of diverse attacks used for more reliable robustness evaluation.\n\n**Key Insights/Contributions Summarized (Relevant for understanding trends):**\n\n*   PEFT methods *fail* or exhibit inferior performance with a standard pretrained model, *even with adversarial finetuning*.\n*   Adversarial linear probing excels at *preserving robustness* from a robust pretrained model.\n*   Transferred robustness (of linear probing) is strongly correlated with transferred accuracy (of standard linear probing), suggesting that linear probing works best when it can effectively adapt features to the target domain.\n*   RoLI *significantly improves robustness* compared to random initialization (RanLI) and achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\n**In summary, this paper contributes to the trend of focusing on initialization strategies, particularly the use of robust pretrained models and the careful design of linear head initialization (RoLI), to achieve state-of-the-art adversarial robustness in image classification with transfer learning.**"

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to the research question, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years (since the paper was written in 2022):\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper *primarily* focuses on **evaluating the suitability of RobustBench** (a benchmark for adversarial robustness) and its reliance on AutoAttack (AA) with l\u221e perturbations (epsilon = 8/255) on CIFAR-10 as a *reliable indicator* for real-world robustness. It argues that this benchmark might be *unrealistic* and *hamper* the development of practically relevant robust methods.  It questions the generalization of results from low-resolution datasets like CIFAR-10 to higher-resolution images and more complex scenarios.  It highlights the detectability of AutoAttack-generated adversarial examples, even with simple detection mechanisms.  Therefore, the paper does *not* directly present new adversarial robustness techniques.\n\n**Key Findings and Arguments (Relevant to Trends, but Indirectly):**\n\nThe paper indirectly touches on trends by highlighting the limitations of a *dominant* benchmarking approach (RobustBench/AutoAttack) and suggesting directions for more realistic evaluations.\n\n1.  **Detectability of AutoAttack Perturbations:**\n\n    *   **Central Argument:**  Adversarial samples generated by AutoAttack with the standard l\u221e, epsilon = 8/255 are *easily detectable* due to the extent of modification they induce in the images. This implies that defenses based on *detecting* adversarial examples are becoming more effective against strong, but easily detectable, attacks like AutoAttack.\n\n    *   **Evidence:** The paper introduces and uses a simple adversarial detector called \"SpectralDefense\" (SD), which utilizes Fourier domain features and a basic classifier (Logistic Regression or Random Forest).  Experiments show significantly *lower Attack Success Rates under Defense (ASRD)* for AutoAttack compared to other attacks.\n\n    *   **Trend Implication:**  A potential trend is the *increasing importance of detectability* as a factor in adversarial robustness.  Defenses are becoming better at identifying and mitigating adversarial perturbations, particularly those that are \"too strong\".\n\n2.  **Impact of Image Resolution:**\n\n    *   **Finding:** The paper finds that the *effectiveness of AutoAttack decreases with increasing image resolution*. In contrast, attacks like DeepFool (DF) and Carlini & Wagner (C&W) maintain their attack strength across different resolutions.\n\n    *   **Trend Implication:** This suggests a trend where research needs to move beyond low-resolution datasets like CIFAR-10 and focus on *evaluating robustness on higher-resolution images* that are more representative of real-world applications.  AutoAttack might not be a suitable benchmark for high resolution images.\n\n3.  **Need for More Realistic Benchmarks:**\n\n    *   **Argument:** The paper strongly suggests that RobustBench's current setup (AutoAttack on CIFAR-10 with specific parameters) may *hamper* the development of practically relevant robust methods.\n\n    *   **Trend Implication:**  A key trend is the growing *awareness and need for more realistic and challenging benchmarks* that better reflect the complexities of real-world adversarial robustness.  This might include:\n\n        *   Evaluation on higher-resolution datasets (e.g., variants of ImageNet).\n        *   Consideration of different attack methods beyond just AutoAttack.\n        *   Evaluation under adaptive attacks where the attacker is aware of the defence.\n        *   The design of perturbations should be as indistinguishable from \"benign\" changes as possible.\n\n4.  **AutoAttack with different Epsilon Values:**\n\n    *   **Argument:** It could be that the low ASRD rate is due to a high choice of epsilon, so they repeated experiments for a range of different epsilon values.\n    *   **Findings:** Even for lower choices of the epsilon-parameter, AutoAttack still appears to modify target images beyond reasonable class boundaries.\n\n**Specific Methods and Tools Mentioned (and their relevance):**\n\n*   **AutoAttack (AA):**  A key attack ensemble used in RobustBench and heavily scrutinized in this paper. It is a parameter-free ensemble of diverse attacks.\n*   **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD):** A popular whitebox attack.\n*   **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM):** A simple and fast adversarial attack.\n*   **Basic Iterative Method (BIM):** An iterative version of FGSM.\n*   **DeepFool (DF):** An untargeted attack aiming to find the minimal perturbation.\n*   **Carlini & Wagner (C&W):** A strong attack based on optimization.\n*   **SpectralDefense (SD):** A simple adversarial detector used in the paper, based on Fourier domain features.

The paper focuses on the lifecycle of AI development and deployment including the training and deployment phases.\n\n**Key Areas and Trends (2021-2023 focus):**\n\n1.  **Attacks:**\n\n    *   **Training-Phase Attacks:**\n        *   The paper discusses poisoning and backdoor attacks. A relevant trend is the increasing concern about backdoor attacks in collaborative learning systems like federated learning, especially those leveraging local model/data heterogeneity for stealth (Zawad et al. 2021).\n        *   Distributed backdoor attacks through trigger pattern decomposition are being explored (Xie et al. 2020).\n        *   Gradient-matching poisoning (Geiping et al. 2021) is a method of targeted poisoning attack.\n    *   **Deployment-Phase Attacks (Evasion Attacks):**\n        *   Evasion attacks aim to find \"similar\" examples that cause a model to misclassify.  The core challenge is defining data similarity, often using \u2113p norms.\n        *   Attacks are categorized based on the attacker's knowledge (white-box, black-box, transfer). Query efficiency is an important metric for black-box attacks.\n        *   The formulation of evasion attacks as constrained optimization problems continues to be a focus, with variations in loss functions and solvers.\n        *   Physical adversarial examples (objects that cause misclassification in the real world) are still a relevant area (Lin et al. 2022).\n        *   Universal perturbations (Wang et al. 2021a) evade all model predictions.\n\n2.  **Defenses:**\n\n    *   **Empirical Defenses:**\n        *   For training-phase attacks, data filtering and model fine-tuning remain important (Tran, Li, and Madry 2018). Neural Cleanse and other methods are used to detect backdoors (Wang et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020a).\n        *   For deployment-phase attacks, adversarial training (Madry et al. 2018) remains a strong empirical defense.\n        *   Attack-independent robust training based on self-progression has been proposed (Cheng et al. 2021).\n        *   Research continues on addressing the trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness with unlabeled data (Carmon et al. 2019; Stanforth et al. 2019), and vision transformers (Shao et al. 2022).\n    *   **Certified Defenses:**\n        *   Randomized smoothing remains an effective, model-agnostic approach (Cohen, Rosenfeld, and Kolter 2019). Defenses have been extended to robustify black-box victim models by leveraging the technique of denoised randomized smoothing (Salman et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2022b).\n    *   **Verification:**\n        *   Verification aims to certify a local robustness radius. Scalability to large networks remains a challenge. (Boopathy et al. 2021) uses the intermediate certified results to train a more certifiable model.\n\n3.  **Novel Applications:**\n\n    *   Adversarial robustness insights are leading to new applications, including:\n        *   Data/model watermarking (Sablayrolles et al. 2020; Aramoon, Chen, and Qu 2021; Wang et al. 2021c).\n        *   Visual prompting (Bahng et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2022b,a).\n        *   Adversarial examples as data augmentation (Hsu et al. 2022).\n        *   Reverse engineering of deception (Gong et al. 2022).\n        *   Uncertainty calibration (Tang, Chen, and Ho 2022).\n\n4.  **Emerging Trends and Challenges:**\n\n    *   **Robustness of Foundation Models:**  A major trend is instilling adversarial robustness into foundation models (Bommasani et al. 2021). Key questions include how to incorporate robustness into pre-training and how to transfer robustness during fine-tuning. (Fan et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021b) show promising results.\n    *   **Practical Adversarial Robustness at Scale:**  There's a growing need for solutions that are scalable to large industry models and don't significantly harm original task performance. This includes rethinking evaluation methodologies and developing plug-and-play defenses (Zhang et al. 2022a).\n    *   **Beyond Classification:**  The principles of adversarial robustness are being applied to other tasks beyond classification.\n\n**Specific Papers Published in the 2021-2023 timeframe (or closely related) mentioned in the text:**\n\n*   Aramoon, O.; Chen, P.-Y.; and Qu, G. 2021.

      "relevancy": "While focused on object detection, this paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy of adversarial attacks. Because image classification is often considered a simpler task compared to object detection, attack techniques might be shared or adapted.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to extract the most relevant information regarding recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**I. Key Findings and Trends (Based on the Paper's Focus - Object Detection but Implicating Image Classification):**\n\n*   **Modern Object Detectors are Potentially More Robust:**  The paper's experiments (specifically in Section V-B3, \"Transferability study\") suggest a trend that more recent object detector architectures (like Transformer-based models such as DeTR, GLIP, Grounding DINO) show greater robustness to adversarial attacks compared to older architectures (like Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, RetinaNet, Libra R-CNN, and FCOS) . This implies advancements in architectural design or training methodologies that inherently improve robustness, even if not explicitly designed as a defense. It is important to remember the paper explicitly studies object detection, so if the attack succeeds on an object detector, it almost certainly succeeds on an image classifier.\n*   **Vision-Language Pretraining Enhances Robustness:** GLIP and Grounding DINO, models employing vision-language pretraining, demonstrate comparatively smaller mAP drops when subjected to adversarial attacks. This hints that pretraining on large datasets with rich semantic information (linking visual features to language) can contribute to increased resilience against adversarial perturbations.\n*   **Transferability of Attacks Decreases on Newer Architectures:** The transferability study reveals that attacks generated on older architectures have a diminished impact when transferred to more recent detector architectures. This reinforces the idea that newer models are learning more robust feature representations or decision boundaries.\n*   **Small Objects Remain a Vulnerability:** Across both older and newer architectures, the paper consistently finds that detections on smaller objects within an image are significantly more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is observed through the higher mAP drops for small objects compared to medium or large objects.\n*   **Ensemble-Based Attacks Improve Transferability:** The paper's experiments confirm that using an ensemble of surrogate models to generate attacks improves the transferability of those attacks to unseen victim models. By training the adversary on multiple models, it learns to exploit vulnerabilities that are common across different architectures, making the resulting attack more potent. The paper mentions that \"A broader range of surrogate models with diverse architectures and types can significantly increase the effectiveness of adversarial attacks.\"\n*   **Limited Research on Defenses for Small Objects**: The paper states that \"To our knowledge, there is currently no research specifically addressing adversarial attacks on small objects, either from the attack or defense perspective. We recommend further investigation into this issue in the future.\"\n\n**II. Relevant Sections and Details from the Paper:**\n\n*   **Abstract:** Highlights the susceptibility of deep learning models to adversarial examples and the focus of the paper on object detection.\n*   **Introduction:** Mentions surveys and evaluations on adversarial attacks for *image classification*, motivating the need for research on object detection.\n*   **Section III (Taxonomy of Adversarial Attacks):** Provides a comprehensive categorization of attacks based on:\n    *   **Adversarial Model:**\n        *   *Environment:* Focus on digital attacks, but notes physical attacks often build upon digital techniques.\n        *   *Knowledge:* White-box, Gray-box, and Black-box attacks (important for understanding the attacker's capabilities).\n        *   *Intent Outcome:* Integrity-based attacks (miscategorization, object fabrication, object vanishing, random output) and availability-based attacks (inference latency).\n        *   *Intent Specificity:* Targeted vs. Non-targeted attacks.\n    *   **Attack Model:**  (Details on how the attack is implemented)\n    *   **Detector Type:**  (One-stage vs. Two-stage, Anchor-based vs. Anchor-free)\n    *   **Component Under Attack:**  (Classification confidence score, objectness score, shape regression, relevance map, features, context, region proposal algorithm, Non-Maximum Suppression, Defence Check)\n    *   **Perturbation Norm:**  (Lp-norm, PSNR) - Important for controlling the perceptibility of the attack.\n    *   **Frequency:**  One-shot vs. Iterative attacks.\n    *   **Attack Specificity:** Image-specific vs. Universal attacks (Universal attacks pose a greater threat).\n    *   **Region Specificity:** On-object, On-background, or Unrestricted.\n    *   **Region Locality:** Patch vs. Entire Image.\n*   **Section IV (Evaluation Metrics):** Describes metrics used to assess attacks and model robustness:\n    *   *Attack Strength:* (mAP, FPR, FNR, Fooling Ratio, Blind Degree)\n    *   *Time Cost:* (Crucial for real-time applications)\n    *   *Number of Queries:* (Relevant for black-box attacks)\n    *   *Perturbation Distortion:* (Perception and Measurement using Lp-norm, PSNR, SSIM)\n    *   *Transferability:* (Cross-image, Cross-resolution, Cross-training-dataset, Cross-backbone, Cross-model)\n    *   *Model Robustness:* (Effective Robustness, Relative Robustness)\n*   **Section V (Evaluation):** Presents the paper's experimental evaluation of open-source adversarial attacks on object detection models. This section contains crucial findings about the effectiveness of different attacks (TOG, EBAD) under various scenarios (white-box, black-box) and the transferability of attacks across different architectures.  Pay close attention to the tables in this section for quantitative results.\n*   **Section VI (Open Areas for Research):** This section *explicitly* states open research areas:\n    *   Adversarial Attacks on modern object detectors have more room for research\n    *   Defences on small objects are particularly needed\n    *   Adversarial attacks based on image rendering are under-explored for the object detection task\n\n**III. Implications for Image Classification (Extrapolating from Object Detection):**\n\nWhile this paper is specifically about object detection, many of the principles and trends observed have implications for image classification:\n\n*   **Architectural Advances:** The increased robustness of modern object detectors likely stems from improvements in feature representation and decision boundaries, which are also relevant to image classification. Newer architectures like Transformers, which are also used in image classification, may inherently be more robust.\n*   **Pretraining:** The positive impact of vision-language pretraining on object detection robustness suggests that similar pretraining strategies could also enhance the robustness of image classification models.\n*   **Ensemble Methods:** The effectiveness of ensemble-based attacks highlights the importance of evaluating robustness against diverse adversaries. Defenses should be designed to be effective against attacks that transfer across different architectures.\n*   **Adversarial Training:**  Although not explicitly discussed as a trend, the general principle of adversarial training (training models on adversarially perturbed examples) remains a crucial defense strategy in both image classification and object detection. The research highlights the need for adversarial training to consider transferability across architectures.\n\n**IV. Limitations and Caveats:**\n\n*   **Object Detection Focus:** This paper *primarily* focuses on adversarial attacks against object detection, not image classification. While there are overlapping principles, direct extrapolation should be done cautiously.\n*   **Specific Attacks and Models Evaluated:** The paper's findings are based on a specific set of attacks and object detection models. Results may vary with different attacks or models.\n*   **Evolving Landscape:** The field of adversarial robustness is rapidly evolving. New attacks and defenses are constantly being developed, so the findings of this paper (while from the last 2 years) represent a snapshot in time.\n\nIn summary, this paper on adversarial attacks for object detection suggests recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, including the increased robustness of newer architectures (like Transformers) and the benefits of vision-language pretraining, the heightened vulnerability of smaller objects, the effectiveness of ensemble-based attacks, and the need for defenses that account for attack transferability. It also specifically highlights areas needing further research."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper, specifically focusing on the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, with an emphasis on papers from the last 2 years (2022-2024 - based on the current date of extraction).  Given the provided document was published in December 2023, we will use the 2 year mark accordingly.\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper**\n\nThe paper is a comprehensive survey and benchmark study on the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) applied to Remote Sensing (RS) imagery, specifically in the context of image classification and object detection tasks.  It considers both natural robustness and adversarial robustness.\n\n**II.  Adversarial Robustness Trends (Image Classification, last 2 years):**\n\nHere's what the paper indicates about recent trends in adversarial robustness, drawing heavily from Section II (Survey) and specific tables:\n\n*   **Increased Attention on Black-Box Attacks:**\n\n    *   The paper explicitly states that researchers are increasingly focusing on black-box attack methods because they are more relevant to real-world adversarial situations.  This is due to the limited knowledge an attacker typically has about the target model's architecture, parameters, or training data.\n    *   Black-box attacks present unique challenges as the attacker lacks access to the internal information of the target model.\n    *   Knowledge gained from a substitute model is utilized to craft adversarial examples for the black-box model, and gradient estimation methods based on query results can also be utilized to approximate the gradients of the black-box model and guide the generation of effective adversarial examples.\n\n*   **Evolving Attack Strategies (Digital Domain):**\n    * The study introduces an intermediate-level attack, which establishes a direct linear mapping from the intermediate-level discrepancies, i.e., between adversarial features and benign features, to prediction loss of the adversarial example.\n\n    *   **Transfer-based attacks:** These attacks leverage knowledge from a substitute model to create adversarial examples that can fool the black-box model.\n    *   **Gradient estimation:** These methods use query results to approximate the gradients of the black-box model, guiding the generation of adversarial examples.\n    *   **Perceptual Sensitivity:** Recent attacks (Perceptual Sensitive Attack (PS Attack) [136]) aim to avoid perturbations that are easily noticeable by humans.\n\n*   **Physical Attacks & Real-World Relevance:**\n\n    *   There's a significant trend towards studying adversarial attacks in the *physical* world.  This is driven by the recognition that attacks in real-world settings are potentially more dangerous than purely digital attacks.\n    *   Physical attacks face challenges:\n        *   Need to withstand the imaging process (lenses, sensors).\n        *   Must be robust to dynamic environments and cross-domain transformations (digital to physical and back).\n        *   Should be as concealed as possible.\n\n    *   **Adversarial Patches:** The paper emphasizes the widespread use of *adversarial patches* as a practical means of implementing physical attacks. These patches manipulate localized pixel regions and can be printed and attached to targets.\n    *   **Camouflage:** Camouflage loss is being incorporated to improve the invisibility of adversarial patches to human perception, ensuring that the perturbations blend with the environment.\n    *   **Other Physical Attack Forms:** The paper also highlights attacks using structured illumination (altering appearance without physical contact) and even laser beams.\n\n*   **Shift towards complex trigger backdoor attacks.**\n     * The paper specifies that there is a need to craft triggered attacks in which attackers can maninuplate the imaging process to intentially induce incorrect predictions.\n\n**III. Specific Papers (2022-2023, Image Classification)**\n\nThe tables provide a good summary of papers, though not all entries may be directly related to \"trends.\" Here are some that seem most relevant (extracted from Tables III and IV):\n\n*   **Digital Attacks (Table III):**\n    *   **HPT [110] (ECCV 2022):** Hidden Perturbation Trojan (HPT) attacks that are invisible.\n    *   **SSA/TSA [111] (arXiv 2022):** Stealthy Synchro-trigger Attack/Targeted Stealthy Attack.\n    *   **BASES [113] (NIPS 2022):** BASES attack\n    *   **_A[3]_ [114] (CVPR 2022):** Adaptive Auto Attack\n    *   **CLPA [133] (AAAI 2022):** Clean-Label Poisoning Availability Attack\n    *   **CISA [20] (TPAMI 2022):** Customized Iteration and Sampling Attack\n    *   **GA [60] (arXiv 2022):** Genetic Algorithms based Attack\n    *   **ILA [134] (TPAMI 2022):** Intermediate-Level Attack\n    *   **MI-FAGSM [135] (TMM 2023):** Momentum Iterative Fast Average Gradient Sign Method\n    *   **PS Attack [136] (IS 2023):** Perceptual Sensitive Attack\n    *   **EA [89] (TIP 2023):** Erosion Attack\n    *   **TSAA [151] (arXiv 2021):** Transferable Sparse Adversarial Attack\n    *   **NAA [150] (CVPR 2022):** Neuron Attribution Based Attack\n    *   **SVRE [152] (CVPR 2022):** Stochastic Variance Reduced Ensemble\n    *   **Top-k Attack [79] (CVPR 2022):** Top-k White-Box and Transferable Black-Box Attack\n    *   **DSM [153] (arXiv 2022):** Dark knowledge based attack\n\n*   **Physical Attacks (Table IV):**\n    *   **ViewFool [167] (NIPS 2022):** Viewpoint based attack\n    *   **AdvCF [92] (arXiv 2022):** Color based attack\n    *   **AdvZL [93] (arXiv 2022):** Zoom based attack\n    *   **ODI [171] (CVPR 2022):** Object-Based Diverse Input\n\n**IV. Key Factors and Considerations**\n\n*   **Attacker's Knowledge:**  The level of information the attacker has about the target model (white-box, gray-box, black-box) is a major factor.\n*   **Visibility of Perturbations:** Research is exploring both invisible (imperceptible) and visible (but perhaps localized or camouflaged) adversarial noise.\n*   **Universality:** Some attacks aim for *universal* perturbations that can fool a model across different inputs.\n*   **Transferability:** A crucial area is creating attacks that *transfer* well, meaning that an adversarial example crafted for one model can also fool another model (especially important in black-box scenarios).\n\n**V. RS Specific Trends**\n\n*   Most attacks against RS imagery classifiers stem from the field of CV.\n\n*UNet-based [10] GAN to enhance the optimizing efficiency and attack efficacy of the generated\nadversarial examples for Synthetic Aperture Radar Automatic Target Recognition (SAR-ATR) models.\n\n*fully black-box universal attack (FBUA) framework for\ncreating a single universal adversarial perturbation against\nSAR target recognition that can be used against a wide\nrange of DNN architectures and a large percentage of target\nimages.\n\n*speckle-variant attack (SVA). The SVA consists of two major modules:\nan iterative gradient-based perturbation generator and a target\nregion extractor.\n\n*novel universal\nadversarial attack method for CNN-SAR image classification.\n\n**Important Caveats:**\n\n*   The document itself *surveys* the literature, so the \"trends\" are based on what research the authors have included.  It doesn't necessarily represent the *entire* field.\n*   The document is *focused* on robustness, and while it mentions attack methods, a paper that focuses solely on *attack* strategies might present a different view of trends.\n*   The \"last 2 years\" is relative to the publication date of *this* survey (December 2023), so the trend identification is limited by that time window.  Anything published in the second half of 2023 might not be fully represented.\n\n**In summary:** The current trends point towards the development of more practical, real-world adversarial attacks. There's a growing interest in black-box methods, physical attacks using adversarial patches and camouflage, and in understanding how to transfer attacks effectively between different models and tasks. This paper also highlights that for remote sensing, existing attack methods are typically ported over from computer vision, indicating a need for more targeted research within remote sensing itself."

      "relevancy": "This paper focuses on adversarial robustness of image classifiers using diffusion models, which is directly relevant to the research question.  It was updated within the last two years.",
      "summary": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided research paper (\"Robust Classification via a Single Diffusion Model\") to extract the most relevant information concerning the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on papers published within the last two years.\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper**\n\n*   **Generative Classifiers for Robustness:** The paper introduces a novel approach, the Robust Diffusion Classifier (RDC), that uses a *generative classifier* built upon pre-trained diffusion models to improve adversarial robustness. This contrasts with the more commonly studied *discriminative classifiers*.\n\n*   **Diffusion Models:** The paper leverages diffusion models, a family of generative models, for adversarial robustness. This approach differs from prior methods that use diffusion models primarily for purifying adversarial noise or augmenting adversarial training data.\n\n**Key Contributions and Findings**\n\n1.  **Robust Diffusion Classifier (RDC):**\n\n    *   RDC is a generative classifier constructed from a *single, pre-trained diffusion model*. It does *not* require training on specific adversarial attacks.\n    *   It estimates class probabilities `p(y|x)` using the conditional likelihood `p(x|y)` (estimated by the diffusion model) through Bayes' theorem.\n    *   RDC first maximizes the data likelihood of a given input and then predicts the class probabilities of the optimized input using the conditional likelihood estimated by the diffusion model.\n    *   To reduce the computational cost, the authors propose a *multi-head diffusion* backbone and efficient sampling strategies.\n    *   Empirically, RDC demonstrates strong robust accuracy against various adaptive attacks.\n\n2.  **Likelihood Maximization:**\n\n    *   A pre-optimization step called *Likelihood Maximization* is introduced to move the input data to regions of high likelihood before feeding it into the diffusion classifier. This aims to address potential inaccuracies in the density estimation of practical diffusion models.\n    *   Likelihood maximization minimizes the unconditional diffusion loss.\n\n3.  **Multi-Head Diffusion:**\n\n    *   The paper proposes a new UNet backbone called multi-head diffusion. It modifies the last convolutional layer to output noise predictions for all classes simultaneously to reduce time complexity.\n\n4.  **Evaluation against Strong Attacks:**\n\n    *   The method is rigorously evaluated against strong adaptive attacks, integrated with AutoAttack, to ensure a comprehensive assessment of robustness.\n\n5.  **Generalization to Unseen Threats:**\n\n    *   RDC exhibits good generalization ability to defend against multiple unseen threats, which is a common limitation of adversarial training methods.\n\n6.  **Gradient Analysis:**\n\n    *   The paper investigates gradient randomness and finds that the gradient variance in RDC is exceptionally low. This indicates the absence of obfuscated gradients, confirming the reliability of the robustness evaluation. The method achieves nearly identical robustness under both exact gradient attack and BPDA attack.\n\n7.  **CIFAR-10 Results:**\n\n    *   RDC achieves 75.67% robust accuracy against \u2113\u221e norm-bounded adaptive attacks with \u03f5\u221e = 8/255 on CIFAR-10.\n    *   This surpasses previous state-of-the-art adversarial training models by +4.77%.\n    *   It also demonstrates a significant improvement (>30%) over adversarial training models, DiffPure, and generative classifiers under unseen threats.\n\n8.  **Restricted ImageNet Results:**\n\n    *   RDC outperforms previous methods by +1.75% on Restricted ImageNet with \u03f5\u221e = 4/255.\n\n9.  **CIFAR-100 Results:**\n    *   RDC still achieves superior result compared with the state-of-the-art adversarially trained models and DiffPure.\n\n**Related Work (Trends and Limitations)**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** Acknowledges adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023b) as an effective defense, but notes its poor generalization to unseen threats (Tram\u00e8r & Boneh, 2019; Laidlaw et al., 2021).\n*   **Adversarial Purification:** Discusses adversarial purification techniques (Liao et al., 2018; Samangouei et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018; Nie et al., 2022) but points out the issue of obfuscated gradients (Athalye et al., 2018) and susceptibility to adaptive attacks (Tramer et al., 2020).\n*   **Generative Classifiers:** Highlights the potential of generative classifiers (Raina et al., 2003; Schott et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Mackowiak et al., 2021) for robustness and well-calibration.  Mentions the use of diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021) and energy-based models as generative classifiers.\n*   **Diffusion Models for Robustness:** Mentions DiffPure (Nie et al., 2022) and adversarial training using diffusion-generated data (Rebuffi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023b). It argues that these methods often rely on discriminative classifiers, which do not fully capture the data distribution.\n\n**Trends Indicated by the Paper**\n\n1.  **Shift Towards Generative Models:** The paper suggests a growing interest in using generative models, particularly diffusion models, directly as classifiers to enhance adversarial robustness, moving beyond their use as data augmentation or purification tools.\n2.  **Focus on Generalization:** There's a clear trend towards developing defenses that generalize well across different, potentially unknown, threat models. Adversarial training's vulnerability to specific attacks is a recognized limitation.\n3.  **Importance of Robust Evaluation:**  The paper emphasizes rigorous evaluation against adaptive attacks, highlighting the need to avoid defenses that rely on obfuscated gradients or other easily circumvented techniques. The use of AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020) for comprehensive evaluation is a key point.\n4.  **Efficiency Considerations:** The development of multi-head diffusion shows an awareness of the computational costs associated with diffusion models and a desire to create more efficient solutions.\n5.  **Leveraging Pre-trained Models:** The RDC approach uses pre-trained diffusion models, which aligns with the trend of leveraging large, pre-trained models in various domains to improve performance and reduce training costs.\n\n**Papers Cited within the Last 2 Years (Indicative of Trends)**\n\nThese citations offer a glimpse into recent works influencing and contextualizing the current research:\n\n*   **Blau et al., 2023:** Classifier robustness enhancement via test-time transformation.\n*   **Chen et al., 2023:** Rethinking model ensemble in transfer-based adversarial attacks.\n*   **Clark & Jaini, 2023:** Text-to-image diffusion models are zero-shot classifiers.\n*   **Debenedetti et al., 2022:** A light recipe to train robust vision transformers.\n*   **Dong et al., 2022:** Random normalization aggregation for adversarial defense.\n*   **Han et al., 2022:** Card: Classification and regression diffusion models.\n*   **Hao et al., 2022:** Gsmooth: Certified robustness against semantic transformations via generalized randomized smoothing.\n*   **Karras et al., 2022:** Elucidating the design space of diffusion-based generative models.\n*   **Li et al., 2023:** Your diffusion model is secretly a zero-shot classifier.\n*   **Liu et al., 2023:** Instaflow: One step is enough for high-quality diffusion-based textto-image generation.\n*   **Nie et al., 2022:** Diffusion models for adversarial purification.\n*   **Poole et al., 2022:** Dreamfusion: Text-to-3d using 2d diffusion.\n*   **Rombach et al., 2022:** High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models.\n*   **Shao et al., 2023:** Catch-up distillation: You only need to train once for accelerating sampling.\n*   **Wang et al., 2022:** Guided diffusion model for adversarial purification.\n*   **Wang et al., 2023a:** Prolificdreamer: High-fidelity and diverse text-to-3d generation with variational score distillation.\n*   **Wang et al., 2023b:** Better diffusion models further improve adversarial training.\n*   **Wei et al., 2023a:** Cfa: Class-wise calibrated fair adversarial training.\n*   **Yang et al., 2022:** Your vit is secretly a hybrid discriminative-generative diffusion model.\n*   **Zhang et al., 2023:** {DiffSmooth}: Certifiably robust learning via diffusion models and local smoothing.\n*   **Chen et al., 2024:** Your diffusion model is secretly a certifiably robust classifier.\n\n**Limitations of the Current Paper (Areas for Future Research)**\n\n*   **Computational Cost:** The paper acknowledges the computational cost of RDC (N + T NFEs).\n*   **Diffusion Model Design:** The authors suggest that designing diffusion models specifically for classification may further improve performance, as they currently use off-the-shelf models.\n\nIn summary, the paper highlights a trend towards generative classifiers based on diffusion models as a promising direction for improving adversarial robustness in image classification.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on the research question: **What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.**\n\n**Paper Title:** Efficient Image-to-Image Diffusion Classifier for Adversarial Robustness\n\n**Key Information to Address the Research Question:**\n\n1.  **Core Idea and Contribution:**\n\n*   The paper introduces a novel **Image-to-Image Diffusion Classifier (IDC)** that converts the image classification task into an image-to-image translation task, specifically to improve adversarial robustness.  Instead of generating high-quality images (as traditional diffusion models do), IDC translates input images to pre-defined *orthogonal image labels* representing different classes.\n\n*   **Efficiency Focus:** The primary motivation is to improve the *efficiency* of diffusion model-based defenses, which are known to be computationally expensive. IDC aims to reduce computational costs by:\n    *   Pruning the U-Net structure within the diffusion model.\n    *   Reducing the number of diffusion timesteps.\n\n*   **Classification Loss:** The paper incorporates a novel classification loss function into the diffusion-based image translation framework to better align the optimization objective with image classification. This loss includes both an intra-class loss (minimizing the distance between the translated image label and the ground truth label) and an inter-class loss (maximizing the distance between the translated image label and other classes).\n\n2.  **Context and Background (Trends in the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Diffusion Models in Adversarial Robustness:** The paper acknowledges the rising trend of using diffusion models (DMs) for adversarial robustness. DM-based defense methods have shown \"great potential\" and \"superior defense capability without adversarial training\" compared to traditional CNN-based methods.  Citations like Chen et al. (2023a), Nie et al. (2022), Li et al. (2023a), and references in the introduction section confirm this trend.\n\n*   **Limitations of Existing DM Defenses:** The paper critically points out a major limitation of existing DM-based defenses: their *high computational cost*. These methods often rely on large-scale pre-trained DMs, making full evaluation and real-world deployment challenging. The introduction section highlights these limitations and serves as the motivation for the IDC's design.\n\n*   **Two main DM-based adversarial defense strategies:**\n    *   Adversarial Purification: Using diffusion models to remove perturbations (e.g., DiffPure, Nie et al. 2022)\n    *   Robust Diffusion Classifiers: Treating diffusion models as naturally robust generative classifiers (e.g., RDC, Chen et al. 2023a).\n\n3.  **Methodology (Details of the IDC):**\n\n*   **Orthogonal Image Labels:** IDC uses pre-defined orthogonal image labels in pixel space to represent different classes. These are generated through QR decomposition of random noise vectors.\n\n*   **Image Translation:** IDC employs an image-to-image translation framework (specifically, it mentions BBDM by Li et al., 2023b) to map input images to these orthogonal image labels.\n\n*   **Diffusion Complexity Reduction:** The paper explicitly focuses on reducing the complexity of diffusion models to make them more efficient. This is achieved by:\n    *   *Network Structure Pruning:* Reducing the number of channels in the U-Net architecture, adjusting the upscale factors, and cutting the number of ResNet blocks.\n    *   *Diffusion Timestep Reduction:* Significantly reducing the number of diffusion timesteps required for inference.\n\n*   **Classification Optimization:** To improve adaptability, IDC optimizes both:\n    *   Intra-class Loss: Minimizing the distance between the translated image label and its corresponding ground truth label.\n    *   Inter-class Loss: Maximizing the distance between the translated image label and image labels of other classes.\n\n4.  **Experimental Results:**\n\n*   The paper presents extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.\n*   **Adversarial Attacks:** The IDC is evaluated against a variety of attacks, including:\n    *   CNN-based attacks: PGD, FGSM, MIFGSM, CW, and AutoAttack\n    *   Attacks used in diffusion-based method evaluation: BPDA+EOT and PGD+EOT\n*   The results demonstrate that IDC achieves competitive or better adversarial robustness compared to both CNN-based and DM-based methods, *while using fewer computational resources (parameters and FLOPs).*\n\n5.  **Key References (last 2 years):**\n\n*   Chen, H.; Dong, Y.; Wang, Z.; Yang, X.; Duan, C.; Su, H.; and Zhu, J. 2023a.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to your research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**1. Focus of the Paper & Relevance:**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on **function-space regularization** for deep Bayesian classification, specifically using a Dirichlet prior in predictive space. While not directly about *adversarial robustness*, it claims to *improve adversarial robustness* as one of its benefits.\n*   Therefore, adversarial robustness is a secondary, but significant, aspect of this work.\n\n**2. Approach to Improving Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   The authors propose using a **Dirichlet prior in the function space** rather than weight-space priors, which they argue are model-specific and difficult to interpret.\n*   The core idea is to treat the outputs of stochastic neural network classifiers as samples from an implicit Dirichlet distribution.  This allows the same function-space prior to be combined with different models without altering the architecture.\n*   The function-space regularization is implemented via an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective. The loss function includes a term that minimizes the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the Dirichlet prior.\n\n**3. Experimental Evidence for Adversarial Robustness (from the Appendices and Abstract):**\n\n*   The paper *mentions* experiments related to adversarial attacks in **Appendix D (Image Classification under Adversarial Attacks)**, but does not provide specific results or details beyond mentioning a range of perturbation values. They state: *\"Although both weight-space and\"* (presumably referring to function-space) *\"are examined\"*, suggesting that they indeed performed experiments on adversarial robustness.\n*   In the abstract, the authors state that they *\"demonstrate scalability, improved uncertainty quantification and adversarial robustness with large-scale image classification experiments.\"* However, concrete numbers and comparisons are missing in the main body.\n\n**4. Implicit Stochastic Processes and Uncertainty:**\n\n*   The paper highlights that their model implicitly defines a stochastic process. The model predicts a K-dimensional Dirichlet distribution for any input *x*, which is induced by the weight distribution.\n\n**5. Gradient Computation Considerations:**\n\n*   The computation of gradients involving the KL divergence term introduces challenges, discussed in Appendix G. The authors approximate the gradients to address these issues.\n\n**6. Related Work (Appendix A):**\n\n*   The paper positions itself relative to other approaches in Bayesian classification and uncertainty quantification, including:\n    *   Prior Networks: These networks directly predict Dirichlet concentration parameters, but the authors differentiate their approach by estimating a posterior Dirichlet from multiple categorical predictions.\n    *   Belief Matching: Belief matching replaces categorical predictions with arithmetic averages, where this paper aims to use these predictions to better model a Dirichlet distribution.\n    *   Evidential Deep Learning: Evidential Deep Learning directly regresses Dirichlet parameters from training data, this paper leverages multiple predictions to estimate a Dirichlet.\n\n**7. Key Equations Related to Regularization (Section 2 & 3):**\n\n*   The loss function being minimized is: `L(\u03b8) = E_{f ~ q}[log p(D|f)] - DKL[q(f|\u03b8) || p(f)]`\n*   Where the KL divergence is calculated using the following estimation:\n    `DKL[q || p] \u2248 (1/M) * sum_{l=1 to L, m=1 to M} [log q(fs(l,m)|\u03b8) - log p(fs(l,m))]`\n\n**8. References of Interest (May Indicate Trends):**\n\nBased on the references included and explicitly mentioned in the document, we can attempt to find references that could be relevant regarding the \"latest trends in adversarial robustness,\" but they are not explicitly tied to the paper's results:\n\n*   Several references related to \"Adversarial Examples\" and \"Adversarial Training\" are present, including Goodfellow et al. (2014) and Madry et al. (2019). However, these are older and would not fit the \"last 2 years\" criterion.\n*   The paper references several ICLR and NeurIPS papers from 2018-2021. A deeper look at the papers that cite this one may yield more trends from the last 2 years.\n\n**In summary:**  This paper contributes to the broader field of adversarial robustness by proposing a function-space regularization technique within a Bayesian deep learning framework. The core idea is to use a Dirichlet prior in the predictive space, estimated from samples generated by the neural network. The paper claims to demonstrate improved adversarial robustness through experiments, although details are limited."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to adversarial robustness trends in image classification, focusing on papers from the last 2 years (2022-2024, given the paper was written in 2022).\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper investigates the Sharpened Cosine Similarity (SCS) layer as a potential replacement for convolutional layers in CNNs.  A key aspect of this investigation is to examine the *adversarial robustness* of SCS-based networks compared to traditional convolutional networks.\n\n**Key Findings Regarding Adversarial Robustness (most relevant to the research question):**\n\n1.  **Initial Exploratory Experiments (Rohrer100K and ResNet18 on 32x32 CIFAR-10):**\n\n    *   The paper found that, initially, SCS-based variants of Rohrer100K and ResNet18 showed *noticeably more adversarial robustness* than their convolution-based counterparts.  This was measured by observing a slower decay in accuracy as the strength of the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial attacks increased.\n    *   The authors hypothesize that this increased robustness is due to the more *interpretable representations* learned by SCS-based networks, meaning they focus more on genuine image features and less on noise, making them less susceptible to adversarial perturbations.\n    *   A convolutional variant with `MaxAbsPool2d` and `ReLU` was an outlier, showing poor accuracy and behaving differently under attack.\n\n2.  **Follow-up Experiments (Rohrer25K - Rohrer583K on 32x32 CIFAR-10):**\n\n    *   Results *differed significantly* from the initial Rohrer100K findings when testing various sized scs-gallery models.\n    *   The `SharpenedSDP/MaxAbsPool2d/ReLU` and `convolution/MaxAbsPool2d/ReLU` variants consistently outperformed the top SCS-based variant in adversarial robustness.\n    *   However, these top adversarially-robust variants also had significantly lower original accuracies.\n    *   There was no significant difference between the remaining SCS, SharpenedSDP, and convolution-based variants, but the top performers with decent accuracy appear to be `SharpenedSDP/MaxAbsPool2d/noReLU`, followed by `SCS/MaxAbsPool2d/ReLU`.\n\n3.  **Follow-up Experiments (ResNet18 on 224x224 CIFAR-10):**\n\n    *   PGD attacks on 224x224 ResNet18 variants also showed a different narrative.\n    *   For variants *without* BatchNorm2d, convolution-based variants were *noticeably more robust* to adversarial attacks.\n    *   *With* BatchNorm2d, the best SCS-based variant maintained a *small but consistent advantage* over convolution-based variants. However, the differences weren't as pronounced as in the 32x32 CIFAR-10 experiments.\n    *   The inclusion or exclusion of BatchNorm2d affected convolution-based variants' adversarial robustness significantly, while not significantly affecting SCS-based variants' robustness.\n\n**Key Takeaways on Adversarial Robustness Trends from the Paper:**\n\n*   **Inconsistent Results:**  The paper highlights that the adversarial robustness benefits of SCS are *not consistent*.  They depend heavily on the specific network architecture, the presence of other layers (like BatchNorm2d), and the image resolution.\n*   **MaxAbsPool2d is important:** The top performers with decent accuracy appear to be `SharpenedSDP/MaxAbsPool2d/noReLU`, followed by `SCS/MaxAbsPool2d/ReLU`.\n\n**Potential Trend Implied (but not definitively stated):**\n\nWhile not a clear \"trend\" in the broader literature, this paper suggests a potential trend:\n\n*   **Context-Dependent Robustness:** Adversarial robustness is not an inherent property of a specific layer type (convolution vs. SCS). Instead, it's a complex interplay of architectural choices and training configurations.\n*   **Importance of Interpretable Features:** More interpretable representations tend to yield more adversarially robust networks.\n\n**Limitations of the Paper (in the context of answering the research question):**\n\n*   **Narrow Focus:** The paper primarily focuses on SCS as a replacement for convolutional layers.  It doesn't provide a broad overview of all adversarial robustness techniques.\n*   **Limited Datasets:**  Experiments are primarily on CIFAR-10 (32x32 and 224x224).  Generalizability to larger, more complex datasets is unknown.\n*   **Specific Attack:** The paper uses PGD attacks. Robustness against other types of attacks is not explored.\n*   **Lack of comparison to SOTA adversarial training methods:** The paper compares SCS to standard training, but not to other methods for improving adversarial robustness.\n\n**In summary,** the paper suggests that SCS layers *can* improve adversarial robustness in certain image classification scenarios, particularly when promoting more interpretable representations. However, this benefit is not guaranteed and is highly dependent on the broader network architecture and training setup. The most important \"trend\" highlighted is the realization that adversarial robustness is a holistic system property rather than something inherent to a particular layer type."

Given the rise of foundation models in image classification, understanding certified robustness against such attacks is highly relevant.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper concerning adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on papers from the last 2 years (although this paper itself appears to be from 2023/2024 given the listed references to that time period) and focusing on the core elements needed to answer the research question:\n\n**I. Core Problem Addressed & Proposed Solution**\n\n*   **Problem:** Few-shot classification, while powerful, is vulnerable to *data poisoning attacks*.  An attacker can manipulate a small number of \"support samples\" used to train the classifier, causing it to misclassify future inputs in a way desired by the attacker. Existing defenses (empirical and certified) are not optimal for this few-shot scenario, particularly when leveraging high-quality feature vectors from foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2).\n\n*   **Proposed Solution: FCert** The paper proposes FCert, the first certified defense against data poisoning attacks specifically tailored for few-shot classification with foundation models.\n    *   FCert leverages the observation that foundation models produce feature vectors where:\n        *   Feature vectors for a testing input would be \"close\" to those of correctly labeled support samples.\n        *   With a limited number of poisoned support samples, most samples from the same class remain unperturbed.\n    *   **Key Idea: Robust Distance Calculation** FCert calculates a *robust distance* between the test input and support samples of each class:\n        1.  Compute feature vector distances between the test input and each support sample within a class.\n        2.  Remove a certain number (*K'*) of the *largest and smallest* distances.\n        3.  Average the remaining distances to get the robust distance.\n    *   Prediction: Predict the class with the smallest robust distance.\n\n**II. FCert's Claims & Guarantees**\n\n*   **Certified Robustness:** FCert *provably* predicts the same label for a testing input under data poisoning attacks when the number of poisoned samples is below a threshold (*certified poisoning size*). The derivation involves:\n    *   Formulating lower/upper bounds for the robust distance under attack as optimization problems.\n    *   Deriving analytical solutions to these problems.\n*   **Tightness:** The paper claims the derived certified poisoning size is *tight*. It's impossible to obtain a larger guarantee without additional assumptions. An empirical attack is constructed to demonstrate that exceeding the certified poisoning size leads to misclassification.\n\n**III. Evaluation & Results**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CUB200-2011, CIFAR-FS, and tieredImageNet.\n*   **Foundation Models:** CLIP (OpenAI) and DINOv2 (Meta).\n*   **Baselines:**\n    *   Few-shot classification methods: ProtoNet and Linear Probing (LP)\n    *   Certified defenses: Bagging, DPA, and k-NN\n*   **Metrics:** *Certified Accuracy* (classification accuracy under arbitrary poisoning attacks).  For baselines without certified guarantees, *empirical accuracy* under a Feature Collision Attack is used (as an upper bound of their actual certified accuracy).\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   FCert maintains classification accuracy when no attacks are present.\n    *   FCert outperforms existing certified defenses and few-shot classification methods *under data poisoning attacks*.  It can tolerate a larger number of poisoned samples.\n    *   FCert has similar computational costs to state-of-the-art few-shot classification methods.\n*   **NLP Domain:** FCert also demonstrates effectiveness in the text domain using PaLM-2 and OpenAI APIs.\n\n**IV. Threat Model**\n\n*   **Attacker Goals:** To poison the support set to cause a classifier to make an arbitrary, attacker-desired prediction for a test input.\n*   **Attacker Knowledge:** The attacker knows everything about the few-shot classification setup, including the support samples, the classification algorithm and parameters, and the foundation model.\n*   **Attack Scenarios:**\n    *   *Group Attack:* The attacker can arbitrarily poison *T* support samples in the entire support set.\n    *   *Individual Attack:* The attacker can poison *T* support samples *from each class*. This is considered a stronger attack.\n\n**V. Limitations and Future Work**\n\n*   **Trusted Foundation Model:** The paper assumes the foundation model is provided by a trusted party and is not itself compromised.\n*   **Other Attacks:** The paper focuses on data poisoning and acknowledges the existence of other attacks like adversarial examples and backdoor attacks.\n*   **Future Directions:**\n    *   Expanding the defense to other tasks (e.g., image segmentation).\n    *   Extending the defense to other attack types (e.g., backdoor attacks).\n    *   Exploring other robust statistics techniques.\n\n**VI.

How This Paper Addresses the Research Question**\n\nThis paper directly addresses the research question (\"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\") by:\n\n*   **Identifying a specific vulnerability:** Data poisoning in few-shot learning, a scenario becoming more relevant with the rise of foundation models.\n*   **Recognizing Limitations:** Pointing out the shortcomings of existing adversarial robustness techniques (both empirical and certified defenses) when applied directly to the few-shot learning domain, especially those that don't leverage the pre-trained features of foundation models.\n*   **Proposing a Novel Solution:** FCert is a new approach tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by few-shot learning and foundation models, and it comes with a *formal, provable robustness guarantee*.\n*   **Benchmarking and Comparison:** The paper rigorously compares FCert against both existing certified defenses and state-of-the-art few-shot classification methods to show its advantages in robustness. It demonstrates this with several common image classification datasets and foundation models, including NLP datasets.\n*   **Providing a Tight Bound:** Demonstrating the tightness of the found robustness bounds.\n\nIn summary, this paper's main contribution is a *specialized* certified defense against data poisoning attacks *specifically in the context of few-shot image classification with foundation models*.  It contributes to the trend of developing more *fine-grained and context-aware* adversarial robustness techniques."

It highlights and compares various approaches:\n    *   *Weight Decay:* A well-known regularization method.\n    *   *Fine-Pruning:*  Pruning convolutional filters based on their activation on clean data.\n    *   *Neural Attention Distillation (NAD):* Fine-tuning a teacher model (poisoned model) and distilling activations to a student model. The paper critiques NAD's potential to transfer backdoors.\n    *   *Neural Cleanse:* Reconstructing trigger patterns to identify and mitigate backdoors.  The paper points out limitations related to universal adversarial perturbations and getting stuck in local minima.\n*    **Calibrated Trigger Inversion:** The paper introduces a novel calibrated trigger inversion method to enhance backdoor detection, building on Neural Cleanse by guiding the optimization procedure using a repaired model. This highlights a trend toward *more sophisticated detection mechanisms*.\n*   **Latent Space Manipulation:** There's a growing trend of defenses operating in the *latent space* of neural networks. The paper proposes a Soft Latent Orthogonalization Loss (SLOL) to maximize the dissimilarity between the latent spaces of poisoned and repaired models, improving robustness.  This is a significant trend.\n*   **Adaptive Attacks:** Recognizing that attackers will adapt, the paper introduces Trigger-Scattering Backdoor (TSB) and Parameter-Controlled Backdoor (PCB) attacks to evaluate the defenses under more realistic, adversarial conditions.  *Adaptive attacks are a clear trend in robustness research.*\n\n**III. Key Trends & Techniques Identified in the Paper (Related Works section)**\n\nThe \"Related Work\" section implicitly identifies several ongoing trends:\n\n*   **Data Collection Mitigation:** Filtering untrusted sources or using consensus-based approaches to improve data quality.\n*   **Dataset Sanitation:** Filtering poisoned samples by analyzing the model's latent space. Techniques mentioned: Spectral decomposition of latents, Activation Clustering, DP-InstaHide, and more recent advancements by Tang et al. and Hayase et al.\n*   **Algorithmic Defenses During Training:** Limiting the influence of individual samples (requiring attackers to poison more data).  Mentioned: Differentially private (DP) training, adversarial training variants.\n*   **Defenses During Deployment:** Preventing backdoor exploitation by modifying model responses at inference time.  Techniques: STRIP (overlaying images), ensembling, Februus (saliency map removal), PatchCleanser (input occlusions).\n\n**IV.

      "relevancy": "This paper discusses a data poisoning attack against federated learning systems using GANs, and a countermeasure. While focused on federated learning, it's relevant because federated learning is used in image classification tasks, and the paper aims to address the robustness against data poisoning attacks.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper and focusing on the last 2 years (2022-2024), here's a detailed extraction of relevant information addressing the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper primarily explores data poisoning attacks in federated learning (FL) systems, focusing on a novel attack method called \"VagueGAN\" and a corresponding defense mechanism (MCD). While the paper does not directly address \"adversarial robustness for image classification\" in the traditional sense (i.e., robustness against small, carefully crafted input perturbations), it *does* touch upon an aspect of adversarial machine learning concerning the robustness of FL systems against malicious data. The focus is thus on robustness against *data poisoning*.\n\n**Key Concepts and Techniques (Relevant to Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   **Data Poisoning Attacks:** The paper highlights data poisoning as a significant threat to FL systems. In this context, adversarial robustness refers to the ability of the FL system to maintain performance despite the presence of poisoned (maliciously crafted) training data.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Attacks:** The central contribution is the VagueGAN model, which *uses* GANs to generate poisoned data. This demonstrates a trend of leveraging GANs in *attack* strategies to create more stealthy and effective data poisoning attacks.\n*   **Stealthiness vs. Effectiveness Trade-off:** A key consideration is balancing the effectiveness of the data poisoning attack (degrading model performance) with its stealthiness (avoiding detection).  This trade-off is a central theme in adversarial machine learning research, and this paper explores it in the context of data poisoning.\n*   **Defense Mechanisms:**  The paper proposes a \"Model Consistency-Based Defense (MCD)\" method. Defenses are obviously critical for adversarial robustness. The trend here is towards analyzing local model consistency as a means of detecting GAN-generated poisoned data.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper uses \"effectiveness\" (measured by the drop in global model accuracy) and \"stealthiness\" (measured by statistical distances between legitimate and poisoned models after dimensionality reduction) to quantify the success of attacks and defenses.  These are relevant metrics for evaluating adversarial robustness in the face of data poisoning.\n\n**Specific Trends and Findings:**\n\n1.  **GANs as Attack Tools:**\n    *   The paper *explicitly* proposes a GAN (VagueGAN) designed to generate poisoned data for attacking FL systems.\n    *   This suggests a trend in adversarial machine learning where GANs are not only used for generating adversarial examples (input perturbations) but also for crafting poisoned training data.\n    *   The goal is to create poisoned data that is \"seemingly legitimate\" but still degrades model performance.\n\n2.  **Focus on Stealthiness:**\n    *   The paper emphasizes the importance of stealthiness in data poisoning attacks.  Existing methods (e.g., label flipping) are often detectable due to statistical anomalies they introduce.\n    *   VagueGAN aims to overcome this limitation by generating data that maintains statistical characteristics of the original data while still being poisonous.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Model Consistency for Defense:**\n    *   The proposed defense (MCD) analyzes the consistency of local models uploaded by clients in FL.\n    *   The core idea is that GAN-generated data will lead to more consistent (less diverse) local models, making it a detectable pattern.\n\n4.  **Unsupervised Approaches:**\n    *   The paper introduces an *unsupervised* variant of VagueGAN, which does not require label information for generating poisoned data.\n    *   This highlights a trend towards developing attack methods that are less reliant on specific knowledge of the target data.\n\n5.  **Evaluation on Standard Datasets:**\n    *   The paper evaluates VagueGAN and MCD on common image classification datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10).\n    *   This facilitates comparisons with other adversarial machine learning techniques.\n\n6.  **Limitations of Existing Defenses:**\n    *   The paper *explicitly states* that existing defense methods (PCA, UMAP, and others) are *not* effective against seemingly legitimate poisoned data, which is the type generated by VagueGAN.\n    *   This suggests that the trend is towards defense mechanisms that go beyond simple outlier detection based on statistical anomalies in training data distributions.\n\n**Explicit Mentions of Recent Work/Trends (Within the Last 2 Years - 2022-2024):**\n\n*   The paper references surveys on federated learning threats ([2], [4], [7], [15]) from 2022 and 2023, indicating an increasing interest in security and privacy aspects of FL, including data poisoning.\n*   It mentions specific defenses against label-flipping attacks using UMAP ([12] - 2022) and cosine similarity-based temporal analysis ([26] - 2023).\n*   It cites work on detecting malicious clients in federated learning via anomaly detection based on client model updates [25] - 2022.\n*   It also references recent work on clean-label poisoning attacks ([23] - 2023) and data poisoning attacks based on inverted loss functions ([22] - 2023).\n*   Several papers published in 2023 focus on model poisoning defenses utilizing GANs, encoder-decoder architectures, global test datasets, or global models, or identify poisoned labels using generators ([30], [32], [33], [34]).\n\n**How This Relates to Image Classification Adversarial Robustness (Indirectly):**\n\nWhile not directly about adversarial perturbations on *inputs* to image classifiers, the paper informs research on adversarial robustness because:\n\n*   It demonstrates a different *attack surface* for image classification systems: the training data itself.\n*   It highlights the importance of considering *broader system-level vulnerabilities* beyond just the classification model.  Federated learning introduces new threat models.\n*   The emphasis on stealthiness and effectiveness trade-offs is *directly relevant* to the design of adversarial attacks and defenses *in general*. The principles are transferable.\n*   The use of GANs to generate adversarial data is a technique that is applied in both input-perturbation attacks and data poisoning attacks.\n\n**In summary, the trends this paper highlights include:**\n\n*   Use of GANs for sophisticated data poisoning attacks.\n*   Emphasis on stealthiness to evade detection.\n*   Analysis of local model consistency as a defense strategy.\n*   Development of unsupervised attack methods.\n*   Recognition of limitations in existing defense mechanisms."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**High-Level Summary:**\n\nThis paper focuses on adversarial robustness in Federated Learning (FL) settings, specifically against *data poisoning attacks*.  While it doesn't directly address *image classification* robustness against *adversarial examples* (small, intentional perturbations to images), it does tackle a significant security concern in distributed image classification using FL: malicious clients injecting corrupted data.\n\n**Key Trends & Techniques (Related to Robustness):**\n\nAlthough the focus is on *data poisoning*, the techniques employed and the comparison to other defenses *are* relevant to the broader landscape of adversarial robustness, particularly in FL for image classification.  Here's what's important:\n\n*   **Defense Against Data Poisoning is a Form of Adversarial Robustness:** Protecting the model from malicious data is, fundamentally, a way of making it robust against adversarial manipulation of the training process.\n*   **Zone Based Deviating Update (ZBDU):** This is the core contribution of the paper. The key idea is to divide clients into zones, aggregate updates within each zone, and then compare individual client updates to the zone-level aggregations. Clients whose updates deviate significantly are suspected of being malicious and their updates are discarded. This paper was published in 2024.\n*   **Precision-Guided Zone Creation:** The client zones aren't randomly assigned. The paper uses a \"precision-guided approach\" (implemented with a modified AFL++ fuzzer) to actively group clients into zones that maximize robustness against data poisoning.  This involves using the global model's accuracy as feedback to guide the zone assignment process.\n*   **Cosine Similarity:** This metric is used to compare client updates with zone-level aggregations.  A low cosine similarity indicates a significant deviation and raises suspicion. The paper explicitly notes that cosine similarity has been used in prior research to identify malicious clients (citing [2, 11, 24, 26, 44]).\n*   **Anomaly Detection:**  The paper frames its approach as an anomaly detection technique.  It explicitly argues that anomaly-based defenses are desirable because they can be *agnostic* to the specific learning algorithm used in the FL system.\n*   **Black-Box Defense:** The FedZZ approach operates in a black-box manner, meaning it doesn't require knowledge of the trained model or the learning task. This makes it broadly applicable.\n*   **Client Selection:** FedZZ also functions as a robust client selection strategy, even in attack-free scenarios.\n*   **Formal Guarantee of Accuracy Increase:** The paper provides a theorem (Theorem 4.1) with a proof that the FedZZ zones calibrator converges towards a local minimum of the loss function, essentially meaning it mathematically guarantees monotonically increasing accuracy.\n\n**Comparison to Other Defenses:**\n\nThe paper includes a detailed comparison to several other defense strategies, which provides insight into the current landscape.  Pay attention to these, as they represent alternative trends in adversarial robustness for FL:\n\n*   **Anomaly Detection:**\n    *   AUROR [38]: Uses clustering to identify indicative features to filter toxic updates.\n    *   Sageflow [34]: Uses staleness-aware grouping, entropy-based filtering, and loss-weighted averaging.\n    *   DeepSight [35] (2022): Analyzes updates in neural networks using NormalizEd UPdate energies (NEUPs). The paper critiques this approach for potential privacy concerns.\n*   **Byzantine-Robust Aggregation:** These techniques aim to reduce the impact of malicious updates through robust aggregation methods. Examples mentioned:\n    *   Krum [4]\n    *   Trimmed Mean (TM) [42]\n    *   Median [42]\n    *   FLTrust [6]:  Relies on a \"root dataset\" at the server, which the paper argues is a limitation.\n    *   FLAME [32] (2021): Tames backdoors in Federated Learning.\n*   **Client Selection Techniques**\n    *   DivFL [3]: Diverse client selection via submodular maximization.\n*   **Gradient Analysis:**\n    *   FL-Defender [18] (2023): A recent defense method\n*   **Update Distribution Analysis**\n    *   LoMar [23] (2023): A Local Defense Against Poisoning Attack\n\n**Limitations of Existing Defenses (According to the Paper):**\n\nThe authors are critical of existing defenses, highlighting these limitations:\n\n*   **Accuracy vs. Robustness Trade-offs:** Some defenses sacrifice accuracy to achieve robustness.\n*   **Requirement for Uniformly Distributed Root Dataset:**  Some defenses (like FLTrust) require a representative dataset at the server, which is often impractical.\n*   **Privacy Concerns:** Some defenses (like DeepSight and LoMar) require analysis of client updates that could leak sensitive information.  The paper emphasizes that FedZZ is designed to be more privacy-preserving.\n*   **Deployment Overhead:** Some defenses require significant changes to the underlying FL algorithm.\n*   **Sensitivity to Non-IID Data:** Many defenses struggle when data is not Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) across clients, which is common in real-world FL scenarios.\n*   **Difficulty Differentiating Malicious and Non-IID Updates:** Some defenses struggle to differentiate between malicious updates and highly non-IID benign updates\n\n**Datasets and Experimental Setup:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR10 and EMNIST (common image classification datasets). Images were scaled to 224x224.\n*   **Model:** ResNet18.\n*   **Attack Methods:** MSimBA, DPA-SLF, and DPA-DLF (data poisoning attacks).\n*   **FL Setup:** 40 clients, 300 global epochs, 5 local epochs.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Your Research Question:**\n\n1.  **Data Poisoning is a Major Concern:** Adversarial robustness in FL for image classification increasingly focuses on defending against data poisoning attacks. This paper and many of the cited works illustrate that.\n2.  **Anomaly Detection is a Popular Approach:** Identifying and filtering out anomalous client updates is a common strategy.\n3.  **Privacy is a Key Consideration:**  Newer defenses are designed with privacy in mind, avoiding techniques that could leak sensitive client data.\n4.  **Handling Non-IID Data is Essential:**  Robustness against non-IID data distributions is a critical requirement for real-world FL deployments.\n5.  **Zone-Based Aggregation:** The ZBDU approach, as introduced by FedZZ, offers a potentially effective and scalable way to mitigate data poisoning attacks. The concept of isolating potentially bad actors into groups is novel.\n6.  **Fuzzing for Robustness:**  The use of a modified AFL++ fuzzer to guide the creation of client zones is a somewhat novel approach that highlights the potential of using fuzzing techniques to improve adversarial robustness.\n7. **Effectiveness over Existing Defenses:** The result of this paper indicate that FedZZ can outperform existing defense methods under single and multi-client attack settings for both the CIFAR10 and EMNIST datasets, especially under realistic attack settings.\n8. **Minimal run-time overhead:** The paper states that using FedZZ with the FL system has no observable run-time overhead.\n\n**Limitations of the Paper (for your research question):**\n\n*   **Focus on Data Poisoning:** The paper *doesn't* directly address robustness against adversarial examples (pixel-level perturbations of images). So, if your primary interest is in defenses against adversarial examples, this paper is only *indirectly* relevant.\n*   **Federated Learning Specific:**  The techniques are primarily designed for Federated Learning settings.\n\nIn summary, while this paper is *not* about defending against adversarial examples in image classification, it *is* highly relevant to the broader topic of adversarial robustness in FL for image classification. It highlights the growing importance of defending against data poisoning and introduces a novel approach (ZBDU) that shows promise. The comparison to other defenses provides a valuable overview of the current research landscape."

      "summary": "Okay, I have reviewed the provided paper and extracted the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"  I will focus on the paper's discussion of recent defenses against adversarial attacks, particularly data poisoning and backdoor attacks, specifically within the context of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information, with an emphasis on recent trends and approaches:\n\n**1.  The Vulnerability of CLIP and Motivation for Defenses**\n\n*   **CLIP's Susceptibility to Attacks:** The paper highlights that CLIP models, despite their success in zero-shot classification and transfer learning, are *highly vulnerable* to targeted data poisoning (TDPA) and backdoor attacks (BA). Surprisingly, even a very small percentage of poisoned data (0.0001% for TDPA and 0.01% for BA) can be sufficient to compromise the model. This high vulnerability stems from how CLIP learns representations by aligning image-text pairs.\n*   **Real-World Threat:**  The paper emphasizes that the large pre-training datasets used for CLIP are often crawled from the internet, making them susceptible to real-world adversarial attacks.\n*   **Need for Defenses during Pre-training:**  The authors argue that it's crucial to protect CLIP *during the pre-training* phase because even a single exposure to poisoned data can be enough to make the attack successful. This contrasts with supervised learning, where models typically need to be trained on poisoned data for multiple epochs.\n\n**2.  Existing Defenses and Their Limitations**\n\nThe paper critically discusses existing defense mechanisms, highlighting their shortcomings and motivating the need for a new approach:\n\n*   **RoCLIP (Yang & Mirzasoleiman, 2023):** This is presented as the *only* previously proposed defense for protecting CLIP *during pre-training*. RoCLIP aims to disassociate poisoned image-caption pairs by matching each image representation with its most similar caption representation in a random caption pool. However, RoCLIP is criticized for causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks, limiting its practical application. The paper states, \"RoCLIP can suffer significant performance drop in downstream performance, limiting its real-world application.\"\n*   **Data Cleansing Methods for Fine-tuning (Yang et al., 2023; Bansal et al., 2023):**  The paper mentions other methods that focus on *cleaning an already poisoned pre-trained CLIP* by fine-tuning on clean data. However, these are deemed unsuitable for defending during the *pre-training* phase itself. Specifically:\n    *   Fine-tuning on a clean dataset of the same scale as the pre-training data (Yang et al., 2023) is \"clearly not applicable to pre-training.\"\n    *   CleanCLIP (Bansal et al., 2023), which fine-tunes on a clean subset of pre-training data using contrastive learning, can actually *increase* the attack success rate if applied during pre-training on poisoned data, as confirmed by Yang & Mirzasoleiman (2023). This is because contrastive learning can inadvertently cluster backdoored images and their captions, strengthening the attack.\n\n**3.  The Proposed Defense: SAFECLIP**\n\nThe paper introduces SAFECLIP as a novel defense mechanism designed to address the limitations of existing approaches and effectively protect CLIP during pre-training. It is the core contribution of this paper and represents the authors' proposed trend for robustness.\n\n*   **SAFECLIP's Key Components:**\n    *   **Unimodal Contrastive Learning (CL) Warmup:** The model is first warmed up by applying separate unimodal contrastive losses to image and caption modalities. This step is crucial for reducing the initial similarity of poisoned image-caption representations and clustering similar images and texts.\n    *   **Low Learning Rate CLIP:** Applying the CLIP loss once to all pairs with a low learning rate to initially associate the image-caption representations, while maintaining a low similarity for poisoned pairs.\n    *   **Safe and Risky Set Separation:**  A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used on the cosine similarity of image-caption representations to divide the data into \"safe\" and \"risky\" sets. Pairs with high cosine similarity are considered safe, while others are deemed risky (potentially poisoned).\n    *   **Selective Pre-training:** The model is pre-trained using the CLIP loss on the safe set and unimodal contrastive losses on the risky set. The size of the safe set is gradually increased during training.\n*   **SAFECLIP's Benefits:** The authors claim that SAFECLIP effectively breaks targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks without harming CLIP's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAFECLIP significantly reduces the success rate of attacks, achieving near-zero attack success rates while maintaining downstream performance.\n\n**4. Experimental Results**\n\n* The experiments are conducted on CC3M, Visual Genome and MSCOCO datasets.\n* SAFECLIP reduces the success rate of targeted data poisoning attacks from 93.75% to 0% and that of various backdoor attacks from up to 100% to 0%, without harming CLIP\u2019s performance.\n* Downstream linear probe and zero-shot (top 1) accuracy of pre-training on CC3M show that SAFECLIP, on average, achieves similar downstream performance to CLIP, while RoCLIP experiences a performance loss of nearly 10% in both linear probe and zero-shot evaluations.\n\n**Summary of Trends:**\n\nBased on this paper, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically in the context of CLIP models, revolve around:\n\n*   **Focus on Pre-training Defenses:** Recognizing that defenses are most effective when applied during the pre-training phase, rather than attempting to clean a poisoned model later.\n*   **Contrastive Learning and Data Separation:** Employing contrastive learning techniques and sophisticated data separation methods (like using GMMs) to identify and isolate potentially poisoned data points.\n*   **Balancing Robustness and Performance:** Developing defense mechanisms that not only mitigate adversarial attacks but also preserve the downstream performance and transferability of the pre-trained CLIP model.  This is a key challenge, as previous defenses like RoCLIP were found to significantly degrade performance.\n*   **Defending Against a Wide Variety of Attacks:** This research aims to provide robustness against TDPA and various backdoor attacks, including BadNet, Blended, and WaNet.\n\nIn essence, this paper suggests a shift towards more proactive and nuanced defense strategies during CLIP pre-training, emphasizing the importance of carefully managing the training data and leveraging contrastive learning principles to build robust and high-performing models. The SAFECLIP method represents the authors' proposed approach to achieving this goal."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of information from the paper relevant to the research question \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years,\" focusing on aspects within the scope of the paper's content and publication date (assumed to be within the last 2 years, based on the SERB, DST grant in 2021 and NeurIPS papers from 2020 and 2021 in the references).\n\n**I. Key Trends and Directions in Adversarial Robustness (as presented in the paper):**\n\n*   **Certified Robustness with Randomized Smoothing (RS):** The paper focuses on this specific type of defense, which provides *mathematically proven probabilistic guarantees* that a classifier's output will be consistent within a defined region around an input. This is a major trend.\n    *   RS works by creating a \"smoothed\" classifier. During inference, the input image is augmented with random noise, and the classifier predicts the most likely class based on these noisy versions.\n    *   Early RS work focused on \u21132 norm perturbations (using Gaussian noise). Later work showed that different noise distributions can provide robustness against other \u2113p norm bounds.\n    *   The paper addresses the limitation that most defenses target a *single* threat model (e.g., robustness only against \u21132 attacks). A key trend is to improve robustness against *multiple* \u2113p norm threat models simultaneously, which the paper tackles.\n\n*   **Combining Multiple Perturbation Bounds (\u21131 and \u21132 Norms):** A critical trend identified and addressed in the paper is improving robustness against more than one \u2113p norm threat models simultaneously. This reflects a move beyond single-attack-type defenses. The paper proposes a novel certification scheme that combines certificates obtained using different noise distributions (Gaussian and Uniform) to optimize results against both \u21131 and \u21132 perturbation norms.\n\n*   **Importance of Noise Distribution in RS:** The paper highlights that different noise distributions are optimal for defending against different \u2113p norm attacks. Gaussian noise is better for \u21132 robustness, and Uniform noise for \u21131. Therefore, choosing and potentially combining noise distributions is an active area of research.\n\n*   **Training Strategies for RS:**\n    *   The paper challenges the common belief that using the *same* noise magnitude during training and certification is optimal. They empirically show this is not always true and explore different combinations.\n    *   The paper introduces a novel training noise distribution: *Normal-Uniform* distribution. This combines Gaussian and Uniform distributions during training to improve robustness against both \u21132 and \u21131 attacks.\n    *   **Regularization:**  The paper proposes a *similarity regularizer* that enforces consistency between the training and inference noise distributions. This regularizer, based on KL-divergence, aligns predictions of Normal-Uniform corrupted images with predictions from individual Normal and Uniform distributions used during certification.\n    *   **Comparison across methods:** the paper proposes to compare defenses by targeting a fixed value of clean accuracy, rather than by fixing the noise used for training/ inference which, can be misleading.\n\n*   **Evaluation Metrics for Certified Robustness:**\n    *   The paper uses *Average Certified Radius (ACR)* as a key metric to evaluate robustness.  ACR captures the average certified radius of all test data points, reflecting how large a perturbation the model can withstand while still making the correct prediction.  The paper emphasizes that ACR captures the robustness-accuracy trade-off.\n\n*   **Empirical vs. Certified Defenses:** The paper contrasts these two approaches.\n    *   **Empirical Defenses:** These are heuristic-based and achieve robustness without mathematical guarantees. Adversarial training (augmenting training data with adversarial attacks) falls into this category. While empirical defenses may achieve high robustness in practice, they lack provable guarantees.\n    *   **Certified Defenses:** These offer provable guarantees. However, they can be computationally expensive or architecture-dependent.  Randomized Smoothing is a certified defense. The paper highlights the need for robustness guarantees, especially in security-critical applications.\n\n**II. Specific Contributions of the Paper (which highlight recent trends):**\n\n*   **Novel Certification Scheme:** A method to combine the benefits of Gaussian and Uniform noise-based smoothed classifiers to improve both \u21131 and \u21132 norm robustness guarantees.\n\n*   **Normal-Uniform Noise Distribution:** Use of this distribution during training to improve certified robustness against both \u21132 and \u21131 attacks. The distribution is designed to be less prone to generating extreme values during training, which improves training stability.\n\n*   **Similarity Regularizer:**  This regularizer helps align the training and certification stages when different noise distributions are used.\n\n*   **Comparison Strategy:** Proposing a new comparison perspective across different methods, by targeting a fixed value of clean accuracy.\n\n**III. Related Works and the Paper's Context (showing relevant recent research):**\n\n*   The paper cites several works from 2018-2021 which is good evidence that this paper is very relevant.\n*   **Empirical Defenses:** The paper mentions adversarial training as a primary method in this category, along with techniques to generate adversarial attacks.\n*   **Certified Defenses:** It categorizes certified defenses into exact methods, convex optimization-based methods, and randomized smoothing. The paper positions itself within the Randomized Smoothing category, highlighting its advantage of being architecture-independent.\n*   **Robustness to Multiple Threat Models:** It refers to existing defenses that aim to achieve robustness against a single adversary type.  It then cites works (including one from 2021) that try to address multiple \u2113p norm attacks simultaneously.\n*   **Randomized Smoothing-based Methods:** The paper mentions recent works that propose regularized robust training methods to improve the certified radius of the smoothed classifier. It cites MACER (Zhai et al., 2020) and a consistency regularization approach (Jeong & Shin, 2020).  The paper emphasizes that its proposed regularizer is better suited to its defense of using Normal-Uniform noise during training.\n\n**In summary, this paper indicates that the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, particularly within the last two years, include:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Certified Robustness:** Moving beyond empirical defenses to achieve mathematically provable guarantees of robustness.\n2.  **Randomized Smoothing is a Promising Approach:** Its architecture independence and relative scalability make it a popular choice for certified defenses.\n3.  **Multi-Norm Robustness:**  Developing defenses that are robust against multiple types of adversarial attacks (different \u2113p norms).\n4.  **Advanced Training Techniques for RS:**  Exploring novel noise distributions (like Normal-Uniform), regularization methods, and training strategies to improve the performance of smoothed classifiers.\n5.  **Emphasis on Meaningful Evaluation:**  Using metrics like ACR that capture the trade-off between robustness and accuracy and comparing methods across fixed levels of clean accuracy."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper \"Projected Randomized Smoothing for Certified Adversarial Robustness\" focusing on answering your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**High-Level Summary:**\n\nThis paper introduces a novel approach called \"projected randomized smoothing\" to improve the certified adversarial robustness of image classifiers. It does so by projecting inputs onto a low-dimensional subspace before applying randomized smoothing, a technique that adds random noise to inputs to \"average out\" adversarial perturbations. The core idea is that adversarial perturbations often exploit vulnerabilities in features that are statistically insignificant and normal to the data manifold. By projecting onto a lower-dimensional space, these vulnerabilities are reduced.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in the Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe paper directly addresses trends related to *certified* adversarial robustness for image classification, with numerous references to recent works. The key trends highlighted and addressed by this paper are:\n\n*   **Randomized Smoothing Generalizations:** The paper mentions the ongoing effort to generalize randomized smoothing to different types of certified regions beyond simple \u21132-balls (e.g., Wasserstein, \u21130-, \u21131-, and \u2113\u221e-balls). It cites Levine & Feizi (2020), Lee et al. (2019), Teng et al. (2020), Yang et al. (2020).\n\n*   **Input-Dependent and Anisotropic Smoothing:** It acknowledges the trend towards optimizing the certified region pointwise in the input space, using input-dependent variances (Alfarra et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) and anisotropic distributions (Eiras et al., 2021; Erdemir et al., 2021; Tecot, 2021). The paper specifically mentions Eiras et al. (2021) maximizing the volume of certified ellipsoids and generalized cross-polytopes.  This shows a move beyond simple spherical robustness guarantees.\n\n*   **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:** The trend of using dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, autoencoders) as a *heuristic* to improve adversarial robustness. It cites Bhagoji et al. (2018), Sahay et al. (2019), Mustafa et al. (2019), and Alemany & Pissinou (2022) as examples. The key contribution of *this* paper is to provide *theoretical robustness guarantees* to such methods. Alemany & Pissinou (2022) shows that decreasing the codimension of data, i.e., decreasing the difference between the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold and the dimension of the input space in which it is embedded, generally leads to increased robustness of models defined on that input space.\n\n*   **Connections between Decision Boundaries and Data Manifolds:** It cites Shamir et al. (2021) which posits that learned decision boundaries tend to align with the natural data manifold, and adversarial perturbations are often normal to this manifold. This motivates the paper's approach of eliminating off-manifold perturbations.\n\n*   **Latent Space Randomized Smoothing:** Zeng et al. (2021) precomposes classifiers with orthogonal encoders and performs randomized smoothing in the encoder\u2019s low-dimensional latent space as a means to speed up the sample-based smoothing procedure. They also provide certified robustness guarantees for general models and data distributions when using dimensionality reduction at the input.\n\n*   **Certified Robustness vs. Empirical Robustness:** The paper explicitly states that its focus is on *certified robustness,* a trend motivated by the \"arms race\" of heuristics being defeated by stronger attacks. It acknowledges the existence of research connecting certified and empirical robustness (Maho et al., 2022), but emphasizes the difficulty in constructing and evaluating suitable empirical attacks.\n\n*   **Emphasis on Volume as a Metric:** The paper adopts the perspective of recent works, e.g., Liu et al. (2019b); Eiras et al. (2021); Tecot (2021), by considering our metric of interest to be the volume of the certified region.\n\n**Specific Details and Techniques:**\n\n*   **Projected Randomized Smoothing:**  The core technique involves projecting inputs into a low-dimensional subspace using a projection matrix `U`. Randomized smoothing is then applied *in this compressed space*. This approach combines the empirical benefits of dimensionality reduction with the theoretical guarantees of randomized smoothing.\n\n*   **Geometry of Certified Regions:**  The paper provides a theoretical characterization of the certified region in the original input space. It shows that the certified region has a hypercylinder shape consisting of a low-dimensional sphere that is \"extruded\" along the nullspace of the projection. This allows the certification of adversarial off-manifold inputs of potentially very large magnitude that are projected back onto the natural data manifold.\n\n*   **Volume Lower Bound:** Due to the unbounded nature of the nullspace, the paper focuses on lower-bounding the volume of the certified region contained within a unit cube of feasible inputs. It leverages results from geometric inequalities and high-dimensional geometry (specifically, a result by Vaaler, 1979) to derive a tractable lower bound.\n\n*   **Algorithm 1 (Prediction and Certification):** A summary of the certification procedure is provided in Algorithm 1.\n\n*   **Experiments:** The paper provides experimental results on CIFAR-10 and SVHN.\n    *   It demonstrates that standard classifiers are vulnerable to attacks in the subspace of low-variance principal components (features that contribute little to classification accuracy).  Projected randomized smoothing is shown to be robust against these attacks.\n    *   It compares the volume of its certified region to baselines like standard randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019), \u21131- and \u2113\u221e-ball randomized smoothing (Yang et al., 2020), and anisotropic ellipsoidal smoothing (Eiras et al., 2021). It shows significant improvements in certified volume.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   **Certified Robustness is Paramount:**  The paper strongly favors provable, certified robustness over empirical heuristics.\n*   **Exploiting Data Manifold Structure:**  A major trend is to leverage the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of data to improve robustness.\n*   **Beyond \u21132-Balls:** Research is actively moving towards certifying more complex and adaptive adversarial regions.\n*   **Computational Challenges:** While the paper provides theoretical guarantees, it acknowledges the computational challenges associated with calculating volume lower bounds in high-dimensional spaces.\n\nIn summary, this paper is very relevant to the research question. It situates its contribution within the landscape of recent advances in adversarial robustness, highlighting the key trends and providing a new method to improve certified robustness by incorporating dimensionality reduction with theoretical guarantees. The numerous citations from the last two years are particularly valuable for understanding the current state-of-the-art."

Core Focus of the Paper (and Relevance to the Research Question):**\n\n*   **Improving Certified Robustness with Diffusion Models:** The central theme is enhancing certified adversarial robustness for image classification by using data generated by diffusion models.  This directly addresses the research question by exploring a novel approach to improve robustness.\n*   **Deterministic Certified Defenses:** The paper focuses on deterministic certified defenses, contrasting them with empirical methods (like adversarial training) and probabilistic certified defenses (like randomized smoothing).\n*   **Threat Models:** The paper investigates robustness against L2 and L-infinity (L\u221e) norm bounded adversarial attacks, which are standard threat models in the field.\n\n**II. Key Findings and Contributions Related to Recent Trends:**\n\n*   **Diffusion Models for Certified Robustness:** The primary finding is that incorporating data generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models during training significantly improves deterministic certified robustness. This leverages recent advancements in generative modeling to bolster defenses.\n\n    *   The paper cites **Wang et al. (2023)** and **Gowal et al.

Models with a larger generalization gap benefit more.\n*   **Recommendations for Scaling Certified Robustness:** The paper provides a list of actionable recommendations for improving deterministic certified models:\n    *   Scale the number of training epochs (most consistent effect).\n    *   Increase model capacity (less fear of overfitting with auxiliary data).\n    *   Benchmark with generated auxiliary data.\n    *   Decrease over-robustness.\n*   **Ratio of Generated vs. Real Data**: The paper finds an optimal ratio of 70% generated and 30% real data in each batch during training.\n\n**III.

(2022)** for the EDM architecture and improvements from **Kim et al. (2023)**\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.  The paper notes they avoided larger datasets like ImageNet because deterministic certified robustness is still marginal on those.\n*   **Architectures:**\n    *   **L2 Robustness:** LOT (**Xu et al., 2022**) and GloroNet (**Hu et al., 2023**).\n    *   **L\u221e Robustness:** SortNet (**Zhang et al., 2022a**) and L\u221e-dist Net (**Zhang et al., 2022b**).\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The paper performs ablation experiments, evaluating:\n    *   Regularization (dropout)\n    *   Number of training epochs\n    *   Optimization schedule (cosine annealing vs. multi-step)\n    *   Balance of real/generated data\n\n**IV. Related Work (Recent and Relevant):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:**  The paper positions its work in contrast to adversarial training, citing **Madry et al. (2018)** as a prominent method.

(2023)** are mentioned regarding the improvement of empirical adversarial robustness using external and synthetically generated data.\n\n**V. Limitations and Future Directions:**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that deterministic methods still have marginal robustness on larger datasets like ImageNet.\n*   The paper mentions that only smoothing-based approaches achieve considerable robustness for the L1 threat model.\n*   The paper suggests future research may consider using smaller certification objectives for samples that already demonstrate considerable robustness.\n*   The paper suggests exploring whether it may be possible to fully train these models on only generated data in the future.\n\n**In summary:** This paper highlights a significant trend in adversarial robustness: leveraging the power of diffusion models to generate training data that improves *certified* robustness, specifically for deterministic defenses.  The paper's recency and experimental results make it highly relevant to the research question about the *latest* trends in the field. The focus on deterministic methods, the use of diffusion models, and the state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are all important aspects of the current landscape."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper (Relevance to Robustness Trends):**\n\n*   The paper focuses on **certified adversarial robustness** for image classification. This is a key area of research in adversarial robustness.  Certified robustness aims to provide provable guarantees about the classifier's resistance to adversarial perturbations within a defined threat model (e.g., bounded L2 norm).\n\n**II. Methodology: Partition-based Randomized Smoothing (PPRS):**\n\n*   **Randomized Smoothing (RS) as a Foundation:** The paper builds upon the well-established randomized smoothing technique. Randomized smoothing involves adding random noise (often Gaussian) to the input image and then classifying the noisy image. The robustness certificate is related to the variance of the noise and the classifier's confidence in its prediction *under noise*.\n*   **Problem Addressed:**  Standard Gaussian smoothing can lead to a significant drop in the classifier's confidence, especially with high noise variances needed for larger certified radii.\n*   **PPRS Innovation:** The core contribution is *Pixel Partitioning-based Randomized Smoothing (PPRS)*.\n    *   **Pixel Partitioning:** PPRS partitions the image pixels into groups (super-pixels).\n    *   **Averaging within Partitions:** It then replaces each pixel's intensity with the *average* intensity of all pixels within its partition.\n    *   **Rationale:** This averaging is intended to improve the *visibility* of the image under noise, thereby boosting the classifier's confidence and, consequently, the certified robustness radius.\n    *   **Super-pixels:** The paper proposes using super-pixel algorithms (e.g., SLIC, Quickshift, Felzenszwalb) to create semantically meaningful partitions. Super-pixels group pixels with similar intensities, aiming to preserve image structure during the averaging process.\n*   **Theoretical Justification:**  The paper provides theoretical analysis, extending the standard randomized smoothing guarantees to PPRS.  It considers both:\n    *   *Static Partitions:* Where the partitioning is fixed and doesn't depend on the input.\n    *   *Dynamic Partitions:* (e.g., super-pixels) Where the partitioning *does* depend on the input image.  Theorem 2 addresses this case.\n*   **Expected outcome:** PPRS improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the randomly perturbed image.\n\n**III. Experimental Evaluation and Results:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.\n*   **Models:** ResNet-18 (for most datasets), and ResNet-101 (for some additional experiments).\n*   **Comparison:** PPRS is compared against standard randomized smoothing (RS).\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   **Improved Certified Accuracy:** PPRS achieves higher certified accuracy than vanilla RS for the same robustness radius.  This suggests that PPRS can provide stronger robustness certificates.\n    *   **Visual Quality Improvement:** Qualitative results (Figure 2) show that PPRS can improve the visual quality of noisy images.\n    *   **Super-pixel Scheme Flexibility:** The choice of super-pixel algorithm (SLIC, Quickshift, Felzenszwalb) does not significantly impact the effectiveness of PPRS.\n    *   **Sensitivity to Super-pixel Size:** The number of super-pixels needs to be tuned.  Too many super-pixels degrade to vanilla RS; too few lose semantic meaning.\n    *   **Effectiveness under Higher Noise:**  PPRS is more effective under higher noise levels (up to a certain threshold).\n*   **Ablation Studies:** The paper includes ablation studies to analyze the impact of different super-pixel schemes and super-pixel sizes.\n*   **Comparison with other smoothing techniques:** The paper compares PPRS with Randomized smoothing using different noises.\n\n**IV.

PPRS is an example of a method designed to address this challenge.\n4.  **Exploiting Semantic Structure:**  There is a trend towards incorporating semantic information into robustness methods. PPRS leverages super-pixels to capture semantic structure and improve robustness.\n5.  **Beyond Gaussian Noise:**  While Gaussian noise is common, researchers are exploring other noise distributions.\n6.  **Task-Specific Adaptations:** Research is expanding the applicability of randomized smoothing and certified robustness to tasks beyond image classification, such as image segmentation and time series analysis.\n\n**Caveats:**\n\n*   This is based on *one* paper. A comprehensive trend analysis would require reviewing many more recent publications.\n*   The paper's \"related work\" section is not exhaustive, so there may be other relevant trends not mentioned.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper's focus on PPRS exemplifies a trend towards improving randomized smoothing by incorporating semantic information and addressing the challenge of maintaining classifier confidence under noise for certified robustness.

      "relevancy": "This paper is relevant because it discusses adversarial attacks and defenses for neural networks, although it focuses on text classification rather than image classification. It was published within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's the relevant information concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically focusing on developments within the last 2 years, as gleaned from the introduction and references:\n\n**Key Focus of the Paper (while not directly image classification, the core defense mechanism is relevant):**\n\n*   The paper focuses on the robustness of 01 loss sign activation neural networks against *text* adversarial attacks, specifically using TextFooler. However, it explicitly draws a connection to earlier work showing the same type of networks are hard to attack in *image* classification. Therefore, the defense mechanism is relevant, even if the application in this paper isn't image classification.\n\n**Defense Mechanism & Findings:**\n\n*   **01 Loss Sign Activation Networks:** The central defense explored is the use of neural networks employing 01 loss and sign activation functions. The authors find these networks are significantly more robust against adversarial attacks (in the text domain) compared to networks using sigmoid activation with cross-entropy loss or binary neural networks.\n*   **CNN01-FS Variation:** A novel variation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using 01 loss and sign activation (CNN01) is introduced.  The key modification, termed \"CNN01-FS,\" involves a different global pooling step. Instead of global average pooling over +1 and -1 activations, it only sums the +1 activations.  This significantly improves adversarial accuracy, rendering TextFooler practically ineffective.\n*   **Ensembles:** The paper highlights that ensembles of 01 loss sign activation networks demonstrate the highest adversarial accuracy, requiring the greatest number of queries from the attacker to be deceived.\n\n**Connection to Image Classification and Earlier Work:**\n\n*   The authors explicitly state: \"Recent work has shown that 01 loss sign activation networks are hard to attack in image classification datasets [7]\u2013[12]. In this paper we investigate its robustness against text black box adversarial attacks.\" This sentence is crucial. It establishes that the *core* defense being investigated *has* a basis in image classification robustness. The citations [7]-[12] should contain image classification research.\n*   The paper's conclusion reinforces this connection: \"Our work here shows that 01 loss sign activation network ensembles are hard to deceive with TextFooler text adversarial attacks. This is consistent with earlier work on image adversarial attacks on the same model. Going forward this may serve as a helpful baseline for robust secure AI models.\"\n\n**Implications for Adversarial Robustness (General, and Potentially Image Classification):**\n\n*   **Gradient-Free Training:** The 01 loss sign activation networks are trained using a gradient-free stochastic coordinate descent (SCD) algorithm. This is relevant because traditional adversarial defenses often rely on gradient-based methods, and defenses effective against gradient-based attacks may not be effective against gradient-free optimized networks.\n*   **Limitations of Probability-Based Attacks:** The authors suggest that TextFooler is less effective against their models because TextFooler relies on output probabilities. Their 01 loss models focus on the *sign* of the outputs, and the ensemble probabilities derived from these signs are not useful enough for TextFooler to mount an effective attack. This implies that adversarial attacks need to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the defense.\n\n**Specific References (Need to be Investigated Further for Image Classification Trends):**\n\nThe most important elements are references [7]-[12] that directly discuss the adversarial robustness of 01 loss sign activation networks:\n\n*   [7] M.

The image classification aspect is supported by earlier publications that directly evaluate the robustness of these networks in the image domain."

      "summary": "Okay, let's analyze the provided research paper and extract the relevant information to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification?

It identifies VLMs as being vulnerable to adversarial examples, similar to traditional visual models. This directly addresses the core theme of the research question.\n\n2.  **Proposed Method: Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT):** The central contribution is a novel method called AdvPT. This technique aims to improve the adversarial robustness of image encoders within VLMs by using learnable prompts. Instead of modifying the image or the model directly, it focuses on manipulating the textual input to achieve robustness.  This is a key piece of information, suggesting a trend of using prompt-based techniques for adversarial defense.\n\n3.  **AdvPT Mechanism:**\n    *   Adversarial images are generated using the image encoder.\n    *   The embeddings of these adversarial images are stored in an \"adversarial embedding bank.\"\n    *   The image encoder is *discarded* after creating the embedding bank.\n    *   Learnable vectors are used as text prompts, and the text encoder is tuned to align clean text embeddings with adversarial image embeddings from the bank.  This is computationally efficient compared to adversarial training.\n    *   The method leverages the knowledge already present in the text encoder to \"rectify\" the adversarial embeddings.\n\n4.  **Experimental Results:**\n\n    *   AdvPT is evaluated against white-box (PGD-40, AutoAttack) and black-box (RAP) adversarial attacks on 8 image datasets (Pets, Flowers, ImageNet, Food101, SUN397, DTD, EuroSAT, UCF101).\n    *   AdvPT outperforms vanilla CLIP (using hand-crafted prompts) in terms of adversarial robustness.\n    *   AdvPT can be combined with input purification methods (diffusion-based methods like DiffPure, super-resolution, rescaling) to further improve robustness.  The combination is shown to be synergistic.\n    *   The paper acknowledges a generalization-robustness trade-off, similar to that seen in traditional adversarial training.\n    *   The learnable vectors demonstrate domain transferability, performing well across different datasets after being trained on one specific dataset.\n\n5.  **Comparison with Existing Defenses:**\n\n    *   The paper contrasts AdvPT with model robustification methods (e.g., Adversarial Training - AT) and input denoising methods.\n    *   Traditional AT is computationally expensive and difficult to apply to large VLMs.\n    *   Input denoising methods (e.g., image rescaling, super-resolution, diffusion-based purification) are more efficient for VLMs.\n    *   AdvPT distinguishes itself by *not* modifying the model or the input image directly.\n\n6.  **Efficiency:** AdvPT is significantly more time-efficient than adversarial training (AT), requiring an order of magnitude less time.\n\n7.  **Linear Prob CLIP:** AdvPT achieves better robustness compared to linear prob CLIP, indicating that simply introducing more downstream data does not guarantee enhanced robustness.\n\n8.  **Domain Shift:** AdvPT outperforms vanilla CLIP in terms of adversarial robustness across different domains, validating its stability.\n\n9.  **Number of Learnable Vectors:** Empirical results suggest that the volume of tunable parameters does not constitute a constraint in AdvPT.\n\n10. **Limitations:** The paper acknowledges limitations: the focus is primarily on image recognition, and exploring visual prompts with more trainable parameters could be a future direction.\n\n**Trends Inferred From the Paper:**\n\n*   **Prompt-Based Defense:** A rising trend of using prompt tuning (especially *adversarial* prompt tuning) as a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks on VLMs.  This is a relatively new approach compared to traditional adversarial training or input manipulation.\n*   **Focus on VLMs:**  Adversarial robustness research is expanding to address the vulnerabilities of Vision-Language Models, which are becoming increasingly prevalent.\n*   **Textual Input as a Defense:** Exploring textual input modifications, rather than just image-based defenses, to improve robustness of image encoders. This could potentially involve manipulating the text prompt to make the model more resilient to adversarial image perturbations.\n*   **Synergistic Defenses:**  Combining prompt-based defenses with existing input purification techniques to achieve even greater robustness.  The paper highlights the \"1 + 1 > 2\" effect of combining AdvPT with input denoising.\n*   **Efficiency Considerations:** A push for more efficient defense mechanisms, particularly those that can be applied to large-scale VLMs without incurring prohibitive computational costs. AdvPT is presented as a computationally efficient alternative to AT.\n*   **Domain Transferability:**  The ability to transfer adversarial robustness across different datasets/domains is an important consideration.\n\n**Explicit Mentions of Relevant Papers (Within the Last 2 Years - 2022-2024):**\n\nI have checked the reference list.\n* Zhang, H., Yu, Y., Jiao, J., Xing, E., El Ghaoui, L., Jordan, M.: Theoretically\nprincipled trade-off between robustness and accuracy for adversarial domain adaptation.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the paper to address your research question:  \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThis paper primarily addresses the *transferability* of adversarial examples in *black-box* attack settings.  It does not directly present a new defense mechanism to improve adversarial robustness, but rather a method to *improve* attacks *against* robust models. However, the work does shed light on the properties of models that enhance robustness, which is relevant to your research question.\n\n**Key Ideas and Contributions (Relevant to Adversarial Robustness Trends):**\n\n*   **Lipschitz Regularized Surrogate (LRS):** The core idea is to *transform* the surrogate model used in transfer-based black-box attacks to make it *easier* to generate adversarial examples that transfer well to other models. LRS uses Lipschitz regularization during the surrogate model's training.\n\n*   **Connection to Surrogate Model Properties and Robustness:** The paper identifies three key properties of surrogate models that influence adversarial transferability:\n    *   **Smaller Local Lipschitz Constant:**  A smaller Lipschitz constant implies a smoother loss landscape, which allows for more stable gradients during adversarial example generation.\n    *   **Smoother Loss Landscape:**  Smoother loss landscapes, characterized by flatter local optima, are less prone to adversarial example overfitting (where the adversarial example works well on the surrogate but not on other models).\n    *   **Stronger Adversarial Robustness:**  Counterintuitively, making the *surrogate* model *more* robust can *improve* the transferability of adversarial examples generated from it.  The rationale is that adversarial examples crafted on a robust surrogate model are more likely to generalize to less robust target models.\n\n*   **LRS-1 and LRS-2:** The paper proposes two specific Lipschitz regularization techniques:\n    *   **LRS-1:** Lipschitz Regularization on the First Order of Loss Landscape. This constrains the norm of the gradient of the loss function.\n    *   **LRS-2:** Lipschitz Regularization on the Second Order of Loss Landscape.  This restricts the Lipschitz continuous gradient, effectively limiting the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the loss function and encouraging a more linear behavior of the surrogate network. This penalizes steep loss surfaces, and encourages optimization towards flatter regions.\n\n*   **LRS-F:** A combination of LRS-1 and LRS-2 is also explored, demonstrating even better performance.\n\n**Why this is relevant to adversarial robustness trends:**\n\n1.  **Adversarial Transferability as a Challenge:**  The paper implicitly acknowledges that *transferability* remains a significant hurdle in black-box attacks.  This suggests that *defenses are becoming more effective at preventing transfer*, requiring attackers to develop more sophisticated methods to overcome this.\n2.  **Focus on Model Properties, Not Just Attack Crafting:**  The paper marks a shift in focus from solely manipulating the adversarial example *generation process* to considering the *properties of the underlying model* used for generating those examples. This indicates a more nuanced understanding of adversarial vulnerability.\n3.  **Lipschitz Regularization and Smoothness:** The use of Lipschitz regularization to improve adversarial transferability relates to a broader trend of using smoothness-inducing techniques to both improve robustness and understand generalization in deep learning.\n4.  **Robust Surrogate for Stronger Attacks:** The finding that *more robust surrogate models* can lead to *more effective attacks* challenges the traditional view that robustness is solely a defensive property. It points to a complex interplay between robustness and transferability.\n\n**Experiments and Results:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.\n*   **Surrogate Models:** DenseNet (CIFAR-10), ResNet-50 (ImageNet).\n*   **Target Models:** Several state-of-the-art classifiers, including VGG-19, ResNet-152, Inception v3, DenseNet, MobileNet v2, SENet, ResNeXt, WRN, PNASNet, and MNASNet. The paper also includes experiments against *adversarially trained* (\"secure\") models.\n*   **Attack Success Rates:** LRS consistently improves attack success rates compared to existing methods. The combined LRS-F often performs the best.  Significant improvements are shown when attacking PyramidNet on CIFAR-10.\n*   **Integration with Other Attacks:** LRS can be easily integrated with existing transfer-based attacks (TIM, Admix, ILA++), further enhancing their performance.\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Show that the performance gains from LRS are relatively consistent across a range of hyperparameter values.\n*   **Empirical Lipschitz Constant Measurement:**  The paper provides empirical measurements demonstrating that LRS-transformed surrogate models exhibit significantly reduced local Lipschitz constants, confirming that the regularization achieves the desired effect of smoothing the loss landscape.\n\n**Specific References to Recent (Within Last 2 Years) Trends/Methods:**\n\n*   **TAIG (Huang and Kong 2022):** Used as a comparison attack method.

While it provides insights into model properties related to robustness, it doesn't directly propose a new *defense* method.\n*   **Limited Scope of Robustness:** The paper focuses on adversarial robustness in the context of *transferability*. It doesn't address other aspects of robustness, such as robustness to different types of perturbations or robustness to real-world noise.\n\n**In summary,** this paper highlights a trend in adversarial robustness research that is focused on understanding the connection between model properties (smoothness, Lipschitzness) and adversarial transferability. It demonstrates a novel attack strategy that leverages these properties to generate more transferable adversarial examples, suggesting that future defenses will need to account for the properties of the models in addition to the crafting of the adversarial examples. The trend of using smoother models to improve robustness is also relevant."

      "summary": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided research paper and extracted the information most relevant to the question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the paper's relevance and findings:\n\n**General Relevance:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Attacks Focus:** The paper centers on adversarial attacks, a core component of evaluating and improving adversarial robustness. While it focuses on attacks, understanding attack methods *is essential* to developing robust defenses.\n*   **Recent Publication:** The paper is published in 2024 (\"CCS '24\") and references works as recent as 2023 and 2022, falling within the \"last 2 years\" window.\n*   **Image Classification Datasets:** It uses standard image classification datasets like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, making its findings directly applicable to the research question.\n\n**Specific Trends & Findings Relevant to Adversarial Robustness (Last 2 Years):**\n\nThis paper focuses on a novel attack paradigm (Certifiable Attack) that addresses limitations of existing black-box attacks and breaks state-of-the-art defenses. This highlights several recent trends in adversarial robustness research:\n\n1.  **Breaking SOTA defenses:** A key trend is the *continued development of attacks that can bypass existing defenses*. The abstract and introduction explicitly state the goal of breaking \"strong SOTA defenses,\" such as detection via query patterns or noise injection.\n    *   The paper notes that existing black-box attacks are becoming easily detectable or interrupted, indicating that robustness research is actively working on *detecting and mitigating* such attacks.\n    *   The proposed Certifiable Attack aims to overcome these defenses by using a high degree of randomness and robustness to randomized defenses.\n2.  **Randomized Defenses:** Randomized defenses, specifically \"randomized defense methods\" injecting noise into inputs, outputs, intermediate features, or model parameters are mentioned as a recent trend.  These defenses aim to obfuscate query results for black-box attacks. The success of the certifiable attack against these defenses indicates that robustness research is still actively trying to counteract these defenses. Examples of randomized defenses mentioned include Blacklight [51].\n3.  **Adversarial Detection:** Blacklight [51] is specifically mentioned as a state-of-the-art defense involving the detection of adversarial examples based on the similarity of queries. The development of attacks that can bypass Blacklight points to the trend of adversarial robustness research needing to account for increasingly sophisticated detection mechanisms. The paper's focus on bypassing this detection is a direct response to this trend.\n4.  **Provable Guarantees/Certifiable Robustness in Attacks:** This is a major theme of the paper.\n    *   The authors introduce \"certifiable black-box attacks that can guarantee the attack success probability (ASP) of adversarial examples before querying over the target model.\" This suggests a move beyond empirical attacks towards attacks with *provable guarantees*, which is linked to certifiable robustness.\n    *   The certifiable attack strategy integrates random noise into queries while preserving adversarial efficacy. This means the attack's success is *theoretically guaranteed*, without needing to verify/query the target model.\n    *   They leverage techniques like Randomized Smoothing (traditionally used in *defenses*) to *certify the attack*.\n5.  **Adversarial Training:** Adversarial training is mentioned as a general defense method that model owners deploy, and it can protect against black-box attacks. The success of the certifiable attack against it is benchmarked.\n6.  **Emphasis on Black-Box Attacks:** The paper highlights the importance of black-box attacks as \"closer to real-world security practice.\" This implies a trend towards adversarial robustness research focusing on scenarios where attackers have limited access to model internals. This means researchers are developing attacks that only need the output labels to perform adversarial attacks.\n7.  **Query Efficiency:** A significant limitation of existing black-box attacks is that they are query inefficient. The Certifiable Attack aims to address this by finding an underlying adversarial distribution, rather than searching adversarial examples one-by-one. This suggests a trend towards developing *more query-efficient attacks*, to reduce costs and avoid detection.\n8.  **Imperceptibility:** Minimizing the perturbation size of adversarial examples to ensure imperceptibility remains a core goal. The paper proposes techniques like \"geometric shifting\" and using diffusion models to denoise adversarial examples, demonstrating the ongoing importance of this aspect. This indicates that adversarial robustness research needs to account for methods that are imperceptible to the human eye.\n9.  **Diffusion Models:** They are leveraged to further denoise the randomized adversarial examples with a guaranteed ASP.\n10. **Noise Detection Based Defenses:** These are designed by training a binary classifier to distinguish the noise-injected inputs and clean inputs.\n\n**Specific Experimental Findings:**\n\n*   **Blacklight Bypassing:** The certifiable attack consistently circumvents Blacklight detection with 0% detection rate and coverage, showcasing a major advancement in bypassing detection-based defenses.\n*   **Robustness to Randomized Defenses (RAND-Pre and RAND-Post):** The certifiable attack maintains a high success rate even against defenses that inject noise into inputs or outputs, demonstrating its robustness against these common mitigation strategies.\n*   **Performance against TRADES:** The paper evaluates the certifiable attack against models trained with TRADES (adversarial training), showing it can achieve high success rates with fewer queries than other attacks.\n\n**Summary of Trends:**\n\nBased on this paper, recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification include:\n\n*   Developing attacks that can break state-of-the-art defenses, including those based on randomized strategies.\n*   Increasing focus on black-box scenarios with limited access to model internals.\n*   Striving for query-efficient attacks to reduce costs and detection risks.\n*   Emphasis on provable guarantees of attack success (certifiable robustness) alongside empirical evaluations.\n*   Continued efforts to minimize the perceptibility of adversarial perturbations.\n*   The utilization of diffusion models for denoising adversarial examples.\n*   Development of Noise Detection Based Defenses.\n\nIt's crucial to note that this is based on *one* paper. A broader review of the literature would provide a more comprehensive picture. However, this paper offers valuable insights into the direction the field is heading."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Overview and Relevance:**\n\nThe paper presents a novel defense mechanism against black-box adversarial attacks by aligning the distribution of adversarial samples with clean samples using Deep Generative Networks (DGNs).  Since the paper was published in 2023, it falls within the last two years, making it relevant to the research question. The paper focuses on adversarial robustness in multiple tasks, including image classification.\n\n**Key Trends/Techniques in Adversarial Robustness (Image Classification):**\n\nThis paper highlights and builds upon the following trends in adversarial robustness, particularly concerning image classification:\n\n1.  **Input Transformation:**\n\n    *   A major defense strategy is transforming input images to increase robustness.  This involves modifying pixel values of adversarial/clean samples to remove the impact of transferable adversarial perturbations.\n\n2.  **Deep Generative Networks (DGNs):**\n\n    *   Using DGNs for input transformation is a prominent trend. DGNs are trained to synthesize outputs from adversarial/clean samples, on which the target model performs well. This aims to reduce differences between adversarial and clean samples.\n    *   The paper cites previous works ([9], [13], [14]) that utilize DGNs for this purpose, highlighting the growing interest in this approach.\n    *   It also notes the three categories of training these DGNs that are being researched:\n        * Pixel-level constraints to reduce differences of pixel values between clean and adversarial samples ([13], [15], [30], [31], [32], [33])\n        * Feature-level constraints to unify representations of clean and adversarial samples ([14])\n        * Simultaneous pixel- and feature-level constraints ([9], [16])\n\n3.  **Distribution Alignment:**\n\n    *   The paper *specifically identifies a lack of overall distribution alignment in feature spaces of target models as a potential problem affecting robustness.* This is a critical point because the paper positions its contribution as addressing this gap.  Existing approaches often focus on reducing the *distance* between clean and adversarial samples in the feature space, but not necessarily aligning their *distributions*.\n\n4.  **Novel Training Constraints (The Paper's Contribution):**\n\n    *   **Pixel-Level Alignment:** The paper introduces new pixel-level training constraints within the DGN framework. It guides the formulation of  \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc50  (corrected clean samples) using clean samples and utilizes \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc50  to help matching adversarial samples.\n    *   **Feature-Level Alignment (Class-Aware Constraint):** The paper proposes a *class-aware* feature-level constraint. This aligns the central feature of clean and adversarial samples *within each class*, maximizing the inter-class distance while minimizing the intra-class distance. This is intended to align the *integrated distribution* of clean and adversarial samples.\n    * The method also aligns behaviors of clean and adversarial samples in feature space using task-oriented loss (classification, segmentation, detection, etc.)\n\n5.  **Defense Generalization:**\n\n    *   The paper claims that the trained DGNs can be generalized to protect models that were *not* part of the training process. This highlights a trend toward creating defenses that are not overly specialized to a particular architecture.\n\n6. **Self-Supervised Adversarial Robustness**\n    * The paper cites [9] which uses a self-supervised approach for adversarial robustness.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Pixel-Level Alignment Details:**\n    *   **Reconstruction Loss (Lr):**  L1 distance between clean samples and generated clean samples + L1 distance between adversarial samples and generated clean samples.  Also employs a perceptual loss (Lp) using a VGG-16 network for visual similarity in pixel level.\n\n    *   **Adversarial Loss (LGAN):**  Uses a discriminator (D) and sets loss terms in the form of LSGAN.  Also adopts a feature match loss (Lm) as an auxiliary part of the adversarial loss.\n\n*   **Feature-Level Alignment Details:**\n\n    *   **Reconstruction Loss (LFrec):**  L1 distance between features of clean samples and features of generated clean samples + L1 distance between features of adversarial samples and features of generated clean samples\n\n    *   **Distribution Alignment Loss (LFclass):** This is class-aware.\n        *   Aligns the distribution of adversarial samples to clean samples by minimizing the distance between clustering centers of clean and adversarial samples within each class.\n        *   Maximizes the inter-class distance and minimizes the intra-class distance.\n\n*   **Overall Training Constraint (Lg):** A weighted sum of the pixel-level losses, feature-level losses, and a task-oriented loss.\n*   **Training Details:**\n    *   Uses Adam optimizer.\n    *   Employs data augmentation.\n    *   Uses PGD attack with KL criterion for image classification during training.\n\n*   **Evaluation:**\n    *   Uses PGD (with cross-entropy and translation-invariant form), DeepFool, and C&W attacks.\n    *   Evaluates using classification accuracy.\n\n**Comparison to Other Methods:**\n\nThe paper compares its approach to:\n\n*   **Adversarial Training Methods:** TRADES [48], Free-adv [54], SAT [57], DDC-AT [57], CLS [58], LOC [58], CON [58], MTD [58]\n*   **Input Transformation Methods:** Defense [30], SR [13], FPD [16], APE [15], Denoise [14], NRP [9]\n\nThe paper claims its method achieves superior robustness on adversarial samples compared to these alternatives, particularly because it addresses the distribution alignment issue.\n\n**Ablation Studies:**\n\nThe paper provides ablation studies that highlight the importance of:\n\n*   Novel pixel-level constraints.\n*   Integrated distribution alignment (the LFclass loss).\n*   Each of the individual loss terms in the overall training constraint.\n\n**Model Transfer Evaluation:**\n\nExperiments show that the trained generator can protect target models not seen during training, indicating good generalization.\n\n**Attacker Knows Defense:**\n\nThe paper analyzes the situation where the attacker knows the existence of defense and utilizes BPDA [76] to bypass the defense.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on black-box attacks, so it doesn't directly address trends in defending against white-box attacks.\n\nIn summary, the paper is highly relevant. It identifies distribution alignment as a key trend and gap in adversarial robustness research and proposes a novel approach that is effective, generalizable, and robust."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last two years.\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper**\n\n*   The paper investigates the adversarial robustness of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in image classification tasks. It compares KANs' resilience to standard neural network architectures (FCNNs and CNNs) under various adversarial attacks.\n*   The experiments involve white-box and black-box attacks on image classification benchmark datasets (MNIST, KMNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN).\n\n**Key Findings Related to Adversarial Robustness Trends (Specific to KANs and Comparisons)**\n\n*   **Size Matters for FCKANs:**  Small and medium-sized Fully Connected KANs (FCKANs) are *not* consistently more robust than their Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) counterparts. However, *large-sized FCKANs generally exhibit greater robustness* than large FCNNs, particularly against certain attacks. This suggests that KANs benefit from increased model capacity in terms of adversarial resilience.\n*   **CKANs show promise:** Convolutional KANs (CKANs) consistently demonstrate greater robustness than CNNs of comparable sizes across most attacks.\n*   **White-Box vs. Black-Box:** The relative performance of KANs and traditional networks varies depending on the type of attack.\n    *   **White-box Iterative Attacks (PGD, C&W, MIM):** Small and medium FCKANs are often *less* robust than small/medium FCNNs.  Large FCKANs show *improved* robustness and can surpass large FCNNs, especially under the C&W attack. The loss function increases more slowly for large FCKANs during these attacks, indicating greater resistance to deception.\n    *   **FGSM (White-Box, Non-Iterative):** Large FCKANs show a *clear* advantage in robustness compared to large FCNNs.\n    *   **Black-Box Attacks (Square, SimBA, NES):** Small FCNNs generally outperform FCKANs. However, larger FCKANs demonstrate improved robustness against SimBA and Square attacks.\n*   **Transferability:** Large FCKANs consistently exhibit lower transferability, implying that adversarial examples crafted to attack other networks are less effective at attacking large FCKANs. This further supports the greater robustness of large FCKANs.  For both fully connected and convolutional models, KANs generally show greater resistance to adversarial attacks (lower transferability) than their standard counterparts for each model size.\n*   **Dataset Complexity:** As dataset complexity increases (e.g., CIFAR-10, SVHN), both CKANs and CNNs become more vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\n*   **Loss convergence:** Loss convergence is faster on complex datasets, meaning adversarial attacks can 'fool' models more easily.\n*   **Vulnerability:** KANs are still vulnerable to adversarial perturbations.\n*   **NES Attack:** For the NES black-box attack, FCKANs failed to classify any adversarial image.\n\n**Experimental Setup Details**\n\n*   **Models:** The study uses \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\" configurations for both fully connected (FCKANs/FCNNs) and convolutional (CKANs/CNNs) architectures. Specific layer configurations and parameter counts are provided in Tables 1 and 2 of the paper. All KAN models were configured with `num_knots = 5` and `spline_order = 3`.\n*   **Datasets:** MNIST, KMNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN.\n*   **Training:** AdamW optimizer, 20 epochs. Learning rates, weight decay, and batch sizes vary depending on the model type and dataset (see Section 3.1).\n*   **Attacks:**\n    *   **White-Box:** FGSM, PGD, C&W, MIM.\n    *   **Black-Box:** Transfer-based, SimBA, Square, NES.\n    *   Hyperparameter settings for the attacks are given in Table 3. Different epsilon values are used for grayscale and multi-channel datasets.\n    *   Black-box attacks are evaluated on a random sample of 1000 images. Transferability is evaluated on 5000 images.\n\n**Relevant Citations (Within the Last 2 Years)**\n\nThe following papers cited are within the last 2 years and are potentially relevant for further investigation into adversarial robustness:\n\n*   **Chen et al., 2024:** Content-based unrestricted adversarial attack.\n*   **Lapid et al., 2024a:** Fortify the guardian, not the treasure: Resilient adversarial detectors.\n*   **Lapid et al., 2024b:** Open sesame! universal black-box jailbreaking of large language models.\n*   **Pinhasov et al., 2024:** XAI-based detection of adversarial attacks on deepfake detectors.\n*   **Bai et al., 2021:** Recent advances in adversarial training for adversarial robustness.\n*   **Kalina et al., 2022:** On combining robustness and regularization in training multilayer perceptrons over small data.\n*   **Wei et al., 2022:** Towards transferable adversarial attacks on vision transformers.\n\n**In summary, this paper presents a timely investigation into the adversarial robustness of KANs, a relatively new architecture, compared to more established neural network types.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focus of the Paper and Relevance:**\n\n*   The paper directly addresses adversarial robustness in image classification, specifically in the context of Vision Transformers pre-trained using BERT-style masked image modeling (MIM).\n*   The paper was published in 2023, making it within the specified time frame (last 2 years).\n\n**Key Findings & Trends Related to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n1.  **Vulnerability of MAE:**\n    *   The paper highlights a crucial observation: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) exhibit significantly *worse* adversarial robustness compared to other BERT pre-training methods like BEiT and PeCo. This is a key finding. Figure 1 clearly shows this performance drop.\n    *   Specifically, MAE suffers a substantial drop in ImageNet-1k top-1 accuracy under l\u221e-norm PGD attacks compared to BEiT and PeCo. (11.5% drop mentioned in the Introduction)\n    *   Table 1 quantitatively confirms this. For instance, at epsilon=0.5/255, MAE's robust accuracy under PGD attack is 14.3%, much lower than supervised (26.2), MoCo v3 (32.1), BEiT (25.0), and PeCo (31.2). Similar trends are observed for other attacks like MIM, BIM and AA. At epsilon=1.0/255, the trend continues. MAE is the worst performing for all attack types.\n    *   This vulnerability of MAE to adversarial attacks is a significant trend/issue identified.\n\n2.  **Importance of Reconstruction Target:**\n    *   The paper's analysis indicates that the adversarial robustness of BERT pre-training is *highly related to the reconstruction target.*\n    *   MAE's reconstruction target is raw pixel values, while BEiT and PeCo reconstruct semantic context (discrete tokens).\n    *   The paper argues that predicting raw pixels forces the model to focus more on medium-/high-frequency components of images, making it more susceptible to adversarial perturbations. This is a *key insight*.\n    *   This is validated by experiments. When medium-/high-frequency components are filtered out of clean images, MAE suffers significantly more accuracy degradation than other pre-training methods (See figures 4 and 5).\n\n3.  **Frequency-Domain Sensitivity:**\n    *   The paper suggests that MAE has a stronger dependence on medium-/high-frequency signals, which makes it more sensitive to the medium-/high-frequency noise introduced by adversarial attacks.\n    *   Frequency saliency maps (Figure 4) generated using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) gradients show that MAE relies more on medium-/high-frequency signals for prediction compared to other methods.\n    *   The experiments involving low-pass filtering (removing high frequencies, Figure 5) shows that MAE is much more sensitive to the removal of this information than other methods. This directly relates to the robustness issue.\n\n4.  **Homogeneity of MAE's Learned Features:**\n    *   The paper also finds that MAE tends to be a more \"homogeneous\" vision learner compared to other methods.\n    *   Visualizations of adversarial perturbations (Figure 6) show that MAE's perturbation is more spatially homogeneous than those of other methods. This is quantified by lower variance of the perturbations (Table 2).\n    *   Analysis of layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the presence of adversarial perturbations (Figure 8) shows that MAE exhibits larger representation deviation in the last three layers.\n    *   Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity calculations (Figure 7) indicate that MAE's spatial tokens show more similarities with the class token compared to supervised learning or MoCo v3, suggesting a more homogeneous attention to image context.\n\n5.  **Defense Strategy: Frequency-Domain Visual Prompting:**\n    *   The paper proposes a novel defense method: **test-time frequency-domain visual prompting.**\n    *   The idea is to learn a set of cluster-specific visual prompts in the frequency domain to enhance medium-/high-frequency signals during test time.\n    *   The prompts are optimized to fill medium-/high-frequency components with dataset-extracted patterns, making it harder to find effective adversarial perturbations in these components.\n    *   Equation 4 details how the visual prompt modifies the image in the fourier space.\n    *   The prompting is done in the frequency domain by adding a learnable patch p to the FFT of the image, masked to constrain prompting to medium/high frequencies (Figure 9).\n    *   Equation 5 describes how the input is assigned a frequency prompt by comparing its latent feature to cluster prototypes.\n    *   The paper uses clustering (Mini-Batch K-means) to create different prompts, one per cluster.\n    *   The optimized prompts are then combined with the original image at test time using a weighted ensemble of logits.\n    *   Table 3 demonstrates the effectiveness of this method. \"Ours\" achieves significantly higher robust accuracy across various attacks (PGD, MIM, BIM, C&W, AA) compared to the baseline MAE, with only a small sacrifice in clean accuracy. (e.g., PGD robust accuracy goes from 1.9% to 69.3%). The ablation studies in table 6 validates each component in the proposed methodology.\n    *   Table 5 shows that the method can also be applied to supervised pretraining, BEiT and PeCo, however, it does not improve as much as in MAE.\n    *   Table 4 shows the method's generalizability over different datasets like DTD and CUB200, and its ability to capture fine grained representations on top of achieving high robust accuracy.\n\n**Specific Details and Supporting Evidence:**\n\n*   **Attacks Used:** PGD, BIM, MIM, C&W, and Auto-Attack (AA) are used to evaluate robustness.\n*   **Backbone Architecture:** ViT-B/16 is used as the backbone for fair comparisons.\n*   **Datasets:** ImageNet-1k is the primary dataset for evaluation. DTD and CUB200 were used as secondary datasets for further testing.\n*   **Code Availability:** The code is available at the provided GitHub link, allowing for reproducibility and further research.\n\n**In summary, the paper reveals the trend that MAE models are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their reliance on high frequency information when reconstructing images at the pixel level. To remedy this, the paper proposes frequency domain visual prompting to improve the adversarial robustness of the model.**"

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**Please note:** While the paper focuses on image restoration, it does reference works and concepts applicable to image classification's adversarial robustness. This response focuses on extracting those elements and trends.\n\n### 1. General Trend: Transformers vs. CNNs in Adversarial Robustness (Image Classification Context)\n\n*   **Initial Belief:**  The paper mentions a trend where Vision Transformers (ViTs) were initially believed to have better adversarial robustness properties than CNNs for image classification ([42, 5, 41, 36]). This was a prevalent idea.\n*   **Counter Evidence:**  However, the paper also cites [32] which demonstrates that vision Transformers can be just as vulnerable as CNNs under strong adversarial attacks.\n*   **Nuance and Clarification:**\n    *   [4] suggests that CNNs can achieve comparable adversarial robustness to Transformers if trained with similar training recipes.\n    *   Transformers are found to outperform CNNs on out-of-distribution generalization [4].\n    *   [46] benchmarks robustness dependent on network architecture, finding Transformers are good against adversarial attacks but very vulnerable to common corruptions and system noise. CNNs are the opposite. MLP-Mixers are in the middle.\n    *   [37] show that ConvNeXt architecture-based CNNs can be as robust as Transformers for image recognition.\n    *    The paper refers to [13] which analyzed architectural components (patches, convolution, activation, attention) and found that ConvNeXts have better adversarial robustness than ResNets.\n\n### 2. Impact of Architectural Components on Robustness\n\n*   **Activation Functions:**\n    *   [56] highlights that *smooth activation functions improve adversarial training* because they enable better gradient updates for computing harder adversarial examples. GELU activations are specifically mentioned for improved robustness ([4, 13]).\n    *   The paper's experiments relate activation function choice (GELU vs ReLU vs \"Simple Gate\") to the types of artifacts produced under attack, suggesting a link between architecture and robustness. Their analysis demonstrates that using ReLU activation in the intermediate network leads to the generation of lesser spectral artifacts.\n*   **Attention Mechanisms:**\n    *   [4] attributes significant robustness gains in Transformers to the self-attention mechanism.\n    *   [52] identified other components besides attention (patches, larger kernels, reduced activation and normalization layers), that when incorporated into CNNs, can lead to out-of-distribution robustness on par with Transformers.\n*  **Model Complexity:**\n    *   Larger models tend to have a better trade-off between robustness and accuracy [22, 24].\n\n### 3. Training Techniques for Robustness (Adversarial Training)\n\n*   **General Effectiveness:** Adversarial training is mentioned as an effective defense against adversarial attacks ([18, 31, 19]).\n*   **FGSM:** The paper uses FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) adversarial training [18] for efficiency.\n*   **Training Regime:** The approach involves using a mixed batch during training: 50% clean samples and 50% adversarially perturbed samples [19].\n*   **Smooth Activation Function Impact:** Subsequent works [4, 13] also confirm improvement in robustness when GELU [23] activation functions are used in adversarial training.\n\n### 4. Attacks Used for Evaluation\n\n*   **PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) attack** [31]: An iterative attack that perturbs samples to maximize loss.\n*   **CosPGD attack** [1]: A variant of PGD, tailored for pixel-wise prediction tasks (though the concept of focusing on pixels with lower initial error can be generalized).\n\n### 5. Limitations and Future Directions\n\n*   The authors acknowledge that the model complexity is reduced at the expense of model robustness. Therefore, a careful and systematic pruning of networks is desired.\n*   The restored images after fixes and during adversarial training are significantly blurry, and methods other than adversarial training could be considered.\n\n### Summary of Trends:\n\n1.  **Transformers' Robustness is Nuanced:** The initial belief that Transformers are inherently more robust than CNNs for image classification is being challenged. Robustness depends heavily on training techniques, specific architectural choices (not just \"Transformer vs. CNN\"), and the type of attack.\n2.  **Architectural Components Matter:**  Activation functions (smooth vs. non-smooth), attention mechanisms, and overall model complexity are crucial factors in adversarial robustness.\n3.  **Adversarial Training Remains Key:** Adversarial training is still a primary defense, and its effectiveness can be influenced by architectural choices.\n4.  **Beyond Accuracy: Generalization:**  The trend is shifting toward considering not only accuracy on clean data but also robustness (generalization ability) under various perturbations and corruptions.\n\nIn short, the latest trends point toward a more granular understanding of adversarial robustness in image classification, moving beyond simplistic \"Transformer vs. CNN\" comparisons and focusing on specific architectural elements and training methodologies."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Reducing Texture Bias of Deep Neural Networks via Edge Enhancing Diffusion\n\n**Relevance Summary:**\n\nThis paper investigates the use of Edge Enhancing Diffusion (EED) to reduce texture bias in deep neural networks (DNNs) and, as a secondary focus, explores the impact of this texture bias reduction on adversarial robustness in *semantic segmentation* and *image classification*. While the primary focus is on texture bias, the paper includes experiments and results related to adversarial robustness, making it relevant to the research question. The key contribution relevant to adversarial robustness lies in the use of EED as a potential pre-processing step to improve a model's resilience to adversarial attacks.\n\n**Key Findings and Information on Adversarial Robustness (relevant to the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **EED as a Defense Mechanism:**\n    *   The paper explores whether EED-based pre-processing increases adversarial robustness. The core idea is that by reducing texture bias, the network becomes less susceptible to adversarial perturbations that might exploit texture-based vulnerabilities.\n    *   The paper tests this hypothesis by applying adversarial attacks to DNNs trained on both original data and EED-processed data.\n*   **Adversarial Attack Methodology:**\n    *   The paper employs the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) in both untargeted and targeted (least likely class) versions to generate adversarial examples.\n    *   Perturbation magnitudes (epsilon values) of 2, 4, 8, and 16 are used.\n*   **Evaluation Metric:**\n    *   Because mIoU values differ for standard and diffusion-based training, the paper introduces a \"relative accuracy\" metric (ACCrel) to compare methods fairly:\n        *   `ACCrel = 1 - (ACCCS - ACCAA) / ACCCS`\n        *   `ACCCS`: Accuracy of the network on clean Cityscapes data.\n        *   `ACCAA`: Accuracy of the network after adversarial attack.\n*   **Results/Observations on Adversarial Robustness:**\n    *   The paper states, \"Thus, generally improved adversarial robustness cannot be claimed. However, EED pre-processing can be used to defend against adversarial attacks\".\n    *   In five cases, specifically the untargeted case with \u03b5 = 16 and all targeted cases, the model trained on EED-processed data outperformed the model trained on original Cityscapes data when attacked with original adversarial Cityscapes images.\n    *   When attacking EED-processed images, results were \"clearly improved compared to CNNs trained and attacked w.r.t. original data,\" suggesting that EED can act as a filter against adversarial attacks.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The results suggest that while EED training might not guarantee universal improvement in adversarial robustness, it can provide a defense, especially when the adversarial attack is applied *after* the EED pre-processing.  This implies EED might be smoothing out or masking the adversarial perturbations.\n\n**Additional Relevant Details:**\n\n*   **Models Used:** The adversarial robustness experiments primarily focus on DeepLabv3+ CNNs.\n*   **Datasets Used:** Cityscapes dataset and EED-processed versions of Cityscapes are used in the experiments.\n*   **Training Regimen:** All networks are trained from scratch (no ImageNet pre-training).\n*   **Limitations:** Limited number of images being insufficient for transformers to achieve their full potential.\n*   **Related Works:**\n\n    *   [2] Andreas Bar, Jonas Lohdefink, Nikhil Kapoor, Serin Varghese, Fabian Huger, Peter Schlicht, and Tim Fingscheidt.

It provides evidence that EED *can* act as a defense, making networks more resilient to attacks applied after the EED transformation. However, it also highlights that EED training alone might not guarantee universal robustness and can sometimes degrade performance against certain attacks.\n\nIn summary, the paper contributes to the understanding of how texture bias reduction can be leveraged to improve adversarial robustness, presenting EED as a promising, but not universally effective, defense mechanism."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here is a detailed extraction of relevant information to address the research question \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**I. General Trends & Findings (Extracted & Summarized from Abstract & Introduction):**\n\n*   **Trade-off between Adversarial and Natural Robustness:** A key finding is the inherent trade-off between robustness to adversarial examples and robustness to natural distribution shifts. Improving adversarial robustness often degrades natural robustness, suggesting that methods effective against adversarial attacks don't necessarily generalize well to real-world corruptions or distribution shifts.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training (AT) Effectiveness:** Adversarial training remains an effective technique for improving adversarial robustness. However, its benefits are not universal, and it can negatively impact performance on natural, unperturbed data.\n\n*   **Transformer Architectures & AT:**  Adversarial training on Transformer architectures shows particularly promising results. Swin Transformer, in particular, demonstrates significant adversarial robustness when adversarially trained. The hierarchical structure and self-attention mechanism of Swin Transformers may allow AT to focus more on global features, benefiting adversarial robustness.\n\n*   **Pre-training Benefits:** Pre-training (both supervised and self-supervised) significantly improves *natural* robustness, making models less susceptible to distribution shifts.  Pre-training can also act as a better initialization for adversarial training (AT), speeding up the AT process.\n\n*   **Modern Architectural Designs:** The paper suggests that modern architectural designs are key to achieving both natural and adversarial robustness.  The paper states that patchified input images, enlarged kernel sizes, and reduced activation and normalization layers play the most important role in adversarial robustness.\n\n**II. Benchmarking & Evaluation (Extracted & Summarized from the paper):**\n\n*   **ARES-Bench:** The paper introduces ARES-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating both natural and adversarial robustness.  It evaluates models against a wide range of adversarial attacks (white-box and black-box) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.\n\n*   **Robustness Curves:**  The benchmark uses robustness curves (accuracy vs. perturbation budget) as a primary evaluation criterion, offering a more comprehensive view of model performance at different noise levels than point-wise metrics.\n\n*   **Models Evaluated:** The benchmark includes 55 models with diverse architectures (CNNs and Transformers) and training methods (normal supervised training, pre-training, self-supervised learning, adversarial training).\n\n**III. Specific Architectures & Techniques (Extracted & Summarized from the paper):**\n\n*   **Swin Transformer:**  The Swin Transformer shows very promising results, especially under adversarial training.\n\n*   **ConvNext:**  The ConvNext architecture is a strong CNN-based contender, achieving comparable natural and adversarial robustness to Transformers with properly designed training.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training Tricks:** The paper investigates various training tricks in large-scale adversarial training, including data augmentation (Mixup, RandAugment), regularization (weight decay, label smoothing), weight averaging (EMA), and pre-training.\n\n**IV. Key Findings & Insights (Extracted & Summarized from the paper):**\n\n*   **Trade-Off Examination:** Confirms that adversarial training leads to degradation of natural robustness to OOD datasets, except for ViT.\n\n*   **Swin Transformer Advantage:** Swin Transformers with AT exhibited robustness exceeding 60% accuracy against l-infinity norm bounded perturbations of 4/255. This suggests a great benefit to adversarial training from hierarchical architecture with self-attention mechanisms\n\n*   **Shape Bias & Generalization:**  While AT models learn shape-biased features, these features may not generalize well to real-world distribution shifts beyond style changes.\n\n*   **Frequency Analysis:**  Adversarially trained models exhibit lower frequency bias, suggesting that AT encourages models to rely more on low-frequency, shape-based features.\n\n**V. White-box and Black-box Adversarial Robustness Evaluation (Extracted & Summarized from the paper):**\n\n* Under white box evaluation, the most robust CNN model was ConvNextL with 60.1% robust accuracy under AutoAttack. The most robust Transformer model was SwinL which achieves 62.3% robust accuracy under AutoAttack.\n\n* Under black-box evaluation ViT models are generally more robust than other models. ConvNext models act as the best surrogate models. Transformers generally perform much better against transfer-based attacks than CNNs. Models of one architecture can, to some extent, defend against perturbations generated from models of different architectures\n\n**VI. Ablation Study on Training Tricks in AT (Extracted & Summarized from the paper):**\n\n* The paper finds that RandAugment, Mixup, label smoothing, weight decay and EMA are training tricks that improve adversarial training by mitigating overfitting. CLIP pre-training lead to a drop in performance, likely due to the fine-tuning process. For 21k pre-training, the finetuning process is accelerated.\n\n**VII. Black-box Transferability across Adversarially Trained Models (Extracted & Summarized from the paper):**\n\n* The models with higher white-box robustness generally have better black-box robustness.\n\n**VIII. Caveats & Limitations (Implied):**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on ImageNet and its variants. Generalizability to other datasets and tasks may vary.\n*   The field of adversarial robustness is rapidly evolving. New attacks and defenses are constantly being developed, so findings may become outdated quickly.\n\n**Summary of Trends:**\n\nBased on the extracted information, the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification are evident:\n\n1.  **Focus on Transformers (Especially Swin):**  Transformer architectures, particularly Swin Transformers, are showing promise in achieving high adversarial robustness through adversarial training.\n\n2.  **Attention to Training Techniques:** Modern training techniques and tricks during adversarial training are just as important as the model architecture. Specifically, proper regularization (weight decay and label smoothing), data augmentation (Mixup, RandAugment) and transfer learning through pre-training seem to have a positive impact on robustness.\n\n3.  **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Benchmarking efforts like ARES-Bench are crucial for accurately evaluating and comparing different robustness methods, considering both adversarial attacks and natural distribution shifts.\n\n4.  **Frequency Domain Analysis:** Using frequency analysis as a tool to explain attention bias.\n\n5.  **Modern Architectural Designs:** High performance CNNs (ConvNext) with appropriate design choices can achieve comparable levels of both natural and adversarial robustness to the Transformers models, which suggests architectural choices related to training play a bigger role in modern robustness than the attention mechanism itself."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Language-Driven Anchors for Zero-Shot Adversarial Robustness\n\n**Publication Date:**  While the paper itself doesn't explicitly state the publication date, the presence of references to papers from 2022 and 2023 (e.g., [26, 29, 30, 34] suggests it was likely written and submitted in late 2022 or 2023, making it within the specified 2-year window.\n\n**Key Areas of Focus & Trends:**\n\n*   **Zero-Shot Adversarial Robustness:** The paper directly addresses the challenging and relatively unexplored area of adversarial robustness in the zero-shot learning (ZSL) setting. This signifies a shift from traditional adversarial robustness research, which primarily focuses on fully supervised learning. The ability to defend against adversarial attacks on *unseen* categories is a significant trend.\n*   **Leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs):**  A major trend is the utilization of large, pre-trained VLMs (specifically CLIP) to enhance adversarial robustness.  Rather than relying solely on image data, the paper uses the semantic information encoded in the *text encoder* of CLIP to guide the training of adversarially robust image classifiers.\n*   **Language-Driven Anchors:** The core idea is to use \"anchors\" derived from the text encoder of a VLM as targets during adversarial training.  These anchors are essentially feature embeddings of text descriptions (category names).  The \"semantic consistency\" of the text encoder (i.e., semantically similar categories map to nearby anchors) is crucial for generalizing to novel categories.\n*   **Addressing the \"High Cosine Similarity (CoS)\" Problem:**  A key contribution is identifying and mitigating a problem specific to using CLIP text encoders for adversarial training.  The paper finds that text embeddings from CLIP have high cosine similarity, making it difficult for the image classifier to learn robust decision boundaries.\n*   **Expansion Algorithm & Alignment Loss:** To address the high CoS issue, the paper proposes an \"expansion algorithm\" to increase the distances between CLIP anchors while preserving their semantic relationships.  An \"Alignment Cross-Entropy (A-CE)\" loss is also introduced to guide the image classifier towards better alignment with the expanded anchors.\n*   **Smoothness Loss:** A \"smoothness loss\" is used to improve the transferability of adversarial robustness to unseen categories. This encourages adversarial features to be similar to benign features.\n*   **Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL):** The paper evaluates the approach in the GZSL setting, which is more practical and challenging than standard ZSL. GZSL involves classifying examples from both seen and novel categories.\n*   **Comparison with Few-Shot Learning:** The paper compares its zero-shot approach against adversarially robust few-shot learning methods, demonstrating competitive (and sometimes superior) performance. This highlights the potential of zero-shot methods to rival few-shot learning in robustness.\n*   **Limitations of Existing Approaches:** The paper points out that previous attempts to combine attribute-based ZSL with adversarial training have had limited success due to the difficulty of obtaining attributes. It also notes that a recent method, TeCoA, which also uses VLMs, is only effective against extremely small adversarial perturbations.\n\n**Specific Techniques & Methods:**\n\n*   **LAAT (Language-driven, Anchor-based Adversarial Training):** The proposed training strategy.\n*   **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training):** Used to extract text embeddings (anchors). ViT-B/16 text encoder is the default.\n*   **Adversarial Training (AT):** A standard technique used to improve adversarial robustness.  PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) is used to generate adversarial examples.\n*   **Anchor-based AT**: Uses l2 normalized feature embeddings for training.\n*   **Cosine Similarity (CoS):** Used to measure the similarity between text embeddings and image features.\n*   **Expansion Algorithm:** Remaps anchors to increase the distances while preserving semantic consistency. Transforms Cartesian coordinates to n-dimensional spherical coordinates.\n*   **Alignment Cross-Entropy (A-CE) Loss:** A composition of CE loss and anchor alignment process\n*   **Smoothness Loss:** Encourages the CoS between adversarial features to be similar to the benign features of an image\n*   **Conv4-512, ResNet12, ViT-B/32, ViT-B/16:** Image classification models used for evaluation.\n\n**Experimental Results:**\n\n*   LAAT achieves competitive performance with few-shot learning methods in standard ZSL settings.\n*   LAAT surpasses SOTA adversarially robust few-shot methods, such as GR [13]\n*   LAAT demonstrates substantial adversarial robustness on downstream datasets in the GZSL setting, significantly outperforming TeCoA [34].\n*   Ablation studies show the effectiveness of the expansion algorithm, A-CE loss, and smoothness loss.\n*   Experiments demonstrate the importance of semantic consistency of the text encoder for zero-shot adversarial robustness.\n\n**Trends Summarized:**\n\n1.  **Zero-shot and Generalized Zero-Shot Adversarial Robustness:**  Moving beyond fully supervised settings to handle novel, unseen categories.\n2.  **Vision-Language Model Integration:** Utilizing the semantic knowledge in VLMs (like CLIP) to improve robustness.\n3.  **Text-Guided Training:**  Using text embeddings as anchors or targets to guide the training of robust image classifiers.\n4.  **Addressing Specific Challenges of VLMs:** Identifying and mitigating issues like high cosine similarity in VLM embeddings.\n5.  **Smoothness Regularization:** Improving the transferability of robustness to novel categories.\n6.  **Benchmarking Against Few-Shot Learning:** Evaluating zero-shot methods against established few-shot learning techniques.\n\nIn essence, this paper highlights a trend towards leveraging the power of pre-trained vision-language models to achieve adversarial robustness in situations where labeled data is scarce or unavailable, specifically in the challenging zero-shot learning setting. The focus is on adapting and refining existing techniques (like adversarial training) by incorporating linguistic information to improve generalization and robustness to novel attacks."

This is particularly important because:\n    *   Many widely used models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\n    *   The specific training data for these models is often not publicly available.\n    *   Retraining for robustness is often costly and leads to performance trade-offs.\n\n**Key Idea: Leveraging Text-to-Image Diffusion Models**\n\n*   The central trend highlighted is the use of recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models to address the challenge of adversarial robustness.\n*   The authors propose a novel framework that utilizes these models as \"denoisers\" within a \"denoised smoothing\" pipeline.\n*   **Denoised Smoothing:** A technique that constructs a robust classifier by combining a denoiser model with a classifier. The denoiser removes noise from the input before it's classified.\n*   **Text-to-Image Diffusion Models as Denoisers:** The paper argues that text-to-image diffusion models, particularly cascaded diffusion models, can serve as effective, data-free denoisers. They generate images based on textual descriptions, allowing them to \"clean\" noisy, adversarially perturbed images.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Contributions**\n\n1.  **Data-Free Robustification:** The core contribution is a method for improving adversarial robustness without using any external image datasets.

The personalization is regularized with a classification loss to ensure the denoised images are correctly classified.\n    *   **Classifier Fine-tuning:**  Further fine-tunes the classifier itself on the denoised images generated by the adapted diffusion model.  This helps to bridge the gap between the distribution of clean and denoised images.\n\n4.  **Super-Resolution Diffusion Models:** They found that super-resolution diffusion models are more effective as denoisers because they are biased towards reconstructing original content rather than generating entirely new images.\n\n5.  **Timestep Correction:** A crucial detail is the \"timestep correction\" method, where a higher diffusion timestep is used during the denoising process to improve performance.

      "summary": "Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overview of the Paper**\n\nThe paper \"Comparing the Robustness of Modern No-Reference Image- and Video-Quality Metrics to Adversarial Attacks\" focuses on evaluating the adversarial robustness of image and video quality metrics, not image classification models directly. It adapts adversarial attacks from computer vision tasks to assess how well these quality metrics resist manipulation. While not directly about image classification *models*, the paper explores the robustness of metrics *used with* or *affected by* image classification and processing pipelines.  The research highlights the vulnerability of deep-learning-based metrics to adversarial attacks, contrasting them with traditional methods like PSNR.\n\n**Key Findings and Trends Related to Adversarial Robustness**\n\n1.  **Vulnerability of Deep Learning-Based Metrics:**\n\n    *   The paper explicitly states that neural network-based image- and video-quality metrics are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks compared to traditional methods.\n    *   This trend underscores the importance of considering adversarial robustness when deploying deep learning models in image processing applications.\n    *   The paper highlights that the possibility to manipulate IQA/VQA metrics scores is already being exploited in different real-life scenarios like decreasing perceptual quality or cheating in benchmarks.\n\n2.  **Adaptation of Adversarial Attacks:**\n\n    *   A key trend is the adaptation of adversarial attacks from computer vision tasks to evaluate the robustness of image/video quality metrics.\n    *   The paper uses FGSM, I-FGSM, MI-FGSM, AMI-FGSM, UAP-based attacks (Cumulative-UAP, Optimized-UAP, Generative-UAP), MADC, and Korhonen et al. attacks.\n\n3.  **Benchmark Development:**\n\n    *   The paper introduces a new benchmark methodology for evaluating the adversarial robustness of quality metrics.\n    *   This signifies a trend toward standardized and rigorous testing of model robustness.\n    *   The benchmark is available online and accepts submissions of new metrics, fostering further research in this area.\n    *   The benchmark methodology, the leaderboard, and an analysis of currently obtained results are the key contributions of this paper.\n\n4.  **Robustness Scores and Metrics**\n   *   The paper introduces different methods for measuring stability to adversarial attacks: Absolute and Relative gain, Robustness Score, Wasserstein Score and Energy Distance Score.\n   *   The paper focuses on analyzing metrics\u2019 resistance to attacks that increase estimated quality scores, as this kind of attack has already appeared in many real-life cases.\n\n5.  **Robust vs. Vulnerable Metrics:**\n\n    *   The study identifies MANIQA, META-IQA, NIMA, RANK-IQA and MDTVSFA as showing high resistance to adversarial attacks. This suggests potential architectural or training strategies that contribute to robustness (more on this below).\n    *   FPR was found to be the least stable metric.\n    *   The paper highlights metrics like PAQ-2-PIQ, VSFA, and FPR as becoming more vulnerable with increasing SSIM degradation.\n\n6.  **Architectural Considerations:**\n\n    *   MANIQA, which uses Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and attention mechanisms, showed good robustness. The paper suggests that interaction among different regions of images globally and locally is a contributing factor.\n    *   META-IQA, which uses a relatively small backbone network and metalearning to incorporate prior knowledge of image distortions, also exhibited high stability.\n    *   A common feature of robust metrics is the usage of the input image cropping or resizing.\n    *   MDTVSFA is the only metric that showed good overall stability and has high correlations with human perception(Antsiferova et al. 2022), and its key features include training on multiple IQA datasets at once.\n\n7.  **Perceptual Awareness:**\n\n    *   The paper uses SSIM, PSNR, and MSE as proxies for estimating perceptual quality loss during attacks.\n    *   It demonstrates that all metrics become less robust when greater quality degradation is allowed. HYPER-IQA is an exception, maintaining relatively consistent robustness regardless of SSIM loss.\n    *   Korhonen and MADC attacks use approaches to reduce the visibility of distortions caused by an attack, which makes it more difficult for them to succeed.\n\n8.  **Statistical Validation:**\n\n    *   The paper employs Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to statistically validate the differences in robustness between different metrics.\n    *   This emphasizes the trend towards rigorous statistical analysis in adversarial robustness research.\n\n9.  **Limitations and Future Directions:**\n\n    *   The paper acknowledges that metrics robust to the tested attacks may still be vulnerable to other attacks.\n    *   It identifies eliminating applied adversarial attacks and investigating attacks together with image-processing defence techniques as areas for future research.\n\n**Specific Details and Examples**\n\n*   **Attacks Used:** The paper used a variety of adversarial attacks, including FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015), I-FGSM (Kurakin et al., 2018), MI-FGSM (Dong et al., 2018), AMI-FGSM (Sang et al., 2022), UAP-based attacks, MADC (Wang and Simoncelli, 2008), and Korhonen et al. (Korhonen and You, 2022).  These attacks are designed to subtly alter images to cause a target model (in this case, the IQA/VQA metric) to misbehave.\n\n*   **Datasets:** COCO, Pascal VOC 2012, Vimeo-90k, NIPS 2017 Adversarial Learning Development Set, and Derf's collection.\n\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Absolute gain, Relative gain, Robustness score, Wasserstein score, Energy Distance score.\n\n*   **MANIQA's Architecture:** MANIQA employs a Vision Transformer (ViT) and attention mechanisms. The paper suggests that ViT's ability to capture both global and local interactions within an image contributes to its robustness.\n\n*   **META-IQA's Training:** The paper credits META-IQA's relative robustness to its training methodology, which involves metalearning to acquire prior knowledge of various image distortions.  This helps the model generalize better and resist adversarial perturbations.\n\n**How this relates to Image Classification (Indirectly)**\n\nWhile the paper doesn't focus on adversarial robustness of *image classification models* directly, it's still relevant to the topic because:\n\n*   **Image quality metrics are often used in conjunction with image classification systems.** For example, an IQA metric might be used to assess the quality of images used to train an image classifier or to evaluate the performance of an image enhancement or restoration step that precedes classification. If these metrics are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, it can indirectly affect the classification system.\n*   **Adversarial attacks on IQA metrics highlight the general vulnerability of deep learning models to subtle perturbations.** The insights gained from studying these attacks can inform strategies for improving the robustness of image classifiers.\n*   **Some robust techniques to image quality metrics may be also robust to image classifiers.**\n*   **Optimization using Image Quality Metrics:** As mentioned in the Introduction, IQA/VQA metrics are being used as a perceptual proxy in loss functions for image restoration and other tasks.  If these metrics are easily manipulated, the resulting optimized images may have poor perceptual quality, which can affect the accuracy of downstream image classification tasks.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nThe paper contributes to the understanding of adversarial robustness by shifting the focus to image and video quality metrics.  It reveals trends in how these metrics are being attacked, identifies which metrics are more resilient, and provides insights into the architectural and training choices that contribute to robustness. While not a direct study of image classification model robustness, the findings have implications for the broader field of image processing and the design of more trustworthy deep learning systems. The paper emphasizes the need for continuous evaluation of adversarial robustness and the development of defense mechanisms."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on papers from the last 2 years (since the paper is from NeurIPS 2023, I will consider 2022 and 2023).\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper (Relevant to the Question):**\n\nThe paper challenges the widely accepted idea that adversarial examples stem from inherent, useful \"non-robust features\" in the data itself. It argues that these features are more like \"paradigm-wise shortcuts\" that only work well within a specific learning setup (e.g., supervised image classification) but fail to generalize across different learning paradigms (e.g., self-supervised learning).  Furthermore, it questions whether robust features are truly robust, especially when considering cross-paradigm settings and more reliable attack methods.\n\n**Key Findings & Arguments (Related to Robustness):**\n\n*   **Non-Robust Features Are Paradigm-Specific:** Non-robust features, while useful in supervised learning, perform poorly when transferred to self-supervised learning paradigms like contrastive learning (SimCLR), masked image modeling (MAE), and diffusion models (DDPM). This suggests they are not truly informative or generalizable features. They are \"paradigm-wise shortcuts.\"\n*   **Robust Features May Not Guarantee Robustness:** The paper finds that datasets constructed to contain only \"robust features\" do *not* necessarily lead to robust classifiers, especially when evaluated using more reliable attack methods like AutoAttack (as opposed to PGD). Models trained on these robust datasets, even with natural training, show limited robustness.\n*   **Cross-Paradigm Robustness is Key:** The paper advocates for evaluating robustness in a \"cross-paradigm\" setting.  A feature or model is truly robust only if it maintains its performance across different learning paradigms and attack methods.\n*   **Adversarial Vulnerability is Multifaceted:** The paper suggests that adversarial vulnerability is not solely a data (feature) problem but also a model problem. Combating vulnerabilities in both data and models is crucial for achieving true robustness.\n*   **Adversarial Transferability is Paradigm-Specific:**  Adversarial examples generated with different learning objectives or using feature encoders from different paradigms exhibit poor transferability to other paradigms. This reinforces the idea that adversarial vulnerabilities are often tied to specific learning setups.\n\n**Specific Methodologies & Experimental Details:**\n\n*   **Datasets:**  The paper uses CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet-200 datasets. It constructs \"robust\" and \"non-robust\" versions of these datasets following the procedure in Ilyas et al. (2019), which involves extracting features from either standardly or adversarially trained classifiers.\n*   **Learning Paradigms:**\n    *   **Supervised Learning (SL):** Standard image classification with cross-entropy loss (using ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and Inception-V3 architectures).\n    *   **Contrastive Learning (CL):** SimCLR (ResNet-18 backbone).\n    *   **Masked Image Modeling (MIM):** MAE (ViT-t backbone).\n    *   **Diffusion Models (DM):** DDPM (U-Net backbone).\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   **Linear Probing:**  Features learned in self-supervised paradigms are evaluated by training a linear classifier on top of the learned representations.\n    *   **Cross-Paradigm Usefulness/Robustness:**  The paper defines these metrics as the *minimum* usefulness/robustness observed across different learning paradigms. They also define \"relative\" metrics, which compare performance to that achieved with raw input images.\n    *   **Attack Methods:**  AutoAttack (l-infinity norm) is used as a more reliable robustness evaluation method. PGD is also used, but the paper notes that it can overestimate robustness.\n*   **Key Experimental Setups:**\n    *   Training models on robust/non-robust datasets using different learning paradigms and evaluating their classification accuracy.\n    *   Evaluating the robustness of models trained on robust datasets against AutoAttack.\n    *   Investigating the transferability of adversarial examples generated with different learning objectives (InfoNCE for CL, cross-entropy for SL).\n\n**Recent Trends Indicated by the Paper (and Relevant Citations):**\n\nWhile the paper primarily critiques existing perspectives, it implicitly points to several recent trends:\n\n1.  **Emphasis on More Reliable Robustness Evaluation:** The paper's reliance on AutoAttack highlights a growing trend toward using more rigorous and comprehensive attack methods for evaluating adversarial robustness.  Croce and Hein (2020) is cited as a key reference here.\n2.  **Self-Supervised Learning for Robustness:**  The investigation of self-supervised learning paradigms (SimCLR, MAE, DDPM) in the context of adversarial robustness reflects increasing interest in using SSL to learn more robust representations.\n3.  **Data Augmentation in Adversarial Training**: The paper mentions the importance of using data augmentation when training on robust datasets. Luo et al. (2023) is cited in this context.\n4.  **Fairness and Adversarial Robustness**: The paper cites Wei et al. (2023), indicating a growing interest in the intersection of fairness and adversarial robustness.\n5.  **Theoretical Understanding of Contrastive Learning**: The paper cites Cui et al. (2023), Wang et al. (2022, 2023), and Zhuo et al. (2023), showing the interest in understanding the learning dynamics of contrastive learning from a theoretical point of view.\n6.  **Masked Autoencoders for Visual Representation Learning**: The paper cites He et al. (2022), showing a growing interest in the applications of masked autoencoders.\n\n**Limitations & Future Directions (Implied by the Paper):**\n\n*   The paper suggests that a mixture of adversarial training on multiple paradigms may be beneficial.\n*   Further research is needed to develop joint training strategies that address both data-level and model-level vulnerabilities.\n*   A more comprehensive study on the connection between different paradigms is needed.\n\nIn summary, the paper challenges existing notions of adversarial robustness, advocating for cross-paradigm evaluation and highlighting the limitations of relying solely on \"robust features\" extracted from specific learning paradigms.  It implicitly points to the need for more robust evaluation methods, the potential of self-supervised learning, and the importance of addressing vulnerabilities at both the data and model levels. The citations also hint at trends in using data augmentation in adversarial training and understanding the theoretical aspects of SSL."

This aligns directly with the area of adversarial robustness.\n\n2.  **Problem Addressed:**  It notes limitations of existing data augmentation techniques like handcrafted mixup, saliency-guided mixup, and even the initial AutoMix. It claims these methods can lead to overfitting and a lack of diversification in the mixed samples.\n\n3.  **Proposed Solution (AdAutomixup):**\n    *   **Adversarial Training:**  The core idea is to have a mixed sample generator and a target classifier that are trained *adversarially*.  The generator tries to create \"hard\" mixed examples to fool the classifier, while the classifier learns to become more robust to these difficult examples. This alternative optimization process between the classifier and the mixup sample generator addresses the research question about adversarial robustness.\n    *   **Attention-Based Generator:** Uses an attention mechanism to dynamically learn discriminating pixels from a sample pair (or multiple samples) along with their corresponding mixed labels, generating a mixing policy matrix.

This allows for more adaptive and data-driven augmentation strategies.\n*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Using attention mechanisms within the data augmentation process is a trend to improve the quality and diversity of generated samples.\n*   **Multi-Image Mixing:** Moving beyond just mixing two images and exploring how to effectively mix multiple images for augmentation can lead to further improvements in robustness.\n*   **Regularization Techniques for Semantic Preservation:**  It's important to use regularization techniques to ensure that adversarial augmentation methods don't destroy the underlying semantic information in the images, as this can hurt performance. Cosine similarity and the EMA teacher model were used.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Date:**  The paper includes references from 2022, 2023, and 2024 making it relevant to your timeframe.\n*   **Code Availability:** The paper mentions that the source code is available at a GitHub repository, which is a plus for reproducibility and further research.\n\nIn summary, this paper provides a valuable snapshot of recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically highlighting the potential of adversarial mixup augmentation with automated and attention-guided methods."

While it focuses on deblurring, it highlights the need for adversarially robust training in image recovery tasks, making it relevant to the broader theme of adversarial robustness in image processing.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the paper to answer your research question, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last two years (2022-2024).  Note that because the paper was written in 2022, the \"last two years\" mostly refers to 2020-2022.\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper**\n\nThis paper primarily investigates the *vulnerability of deep learning-based image deblurring networks to adversarial attacks*.  It demonstrates that even small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input of these networks can significantly degrade their performance. While the paper itself does not directly address adversarial robustness in *image classification*, it explores the concept of adversarial attacks and defenses within the related domain of image restoration (specifically, deblurring).  We can still glean relevant insights from its discussion of related work and its analysis of robustness.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness in Image Classification (Inferences and Connections)**\n\nEven though the paper tackles image deblurring, it highlights the broader trend of adversarial vulnerability in deep learning models, a concern that is VERY relevant to image classification. The success of adversarial attacks against deblurring networks underscores the need for more robust models across *all* computer vision tasks, including classification.\n\n**Key Findings and Insights (Applicable to Image Classification)**\n\n*   **Adversarial vulnerability exists beyond classification:** The paper's core finding is that deep learning models for image deblurring are susceptible to adversarial attacks. This reinforces the understanding that adversarial vulnerability is a general issue affecting many types of deep learning models, not just classifiers.\n\n*   **Targeted and Untargeted Attacks:** The paper considers both untargeted attacks (simply degrading performance) and targeted attacks (forcing the network to produce a specific, incorrect output). Both types of attacks are relevant to image classification. Targeted attacks are particularly concerning in classification, as they could cause a model to misclassify an image as a specific, incorrect class.\n\n*   **Impact of Training Data:** The paper suggests that networks trained *only* on clean data (in this case, sharp images) are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  It mentions that blind deblurring methods that only use clean data during training are more susceptible to adversarial perturbations than the methods that also add noise to blurry images during training. This implies that training strategies that incorporate adversarial examples or noisy data can improve robustness (a well-established finding in image classification). It cites work [24] which confirms that addition of noise during training as an effective way to improve adversarial robustness.\n\n*   **Model Architecture Matters:** The paper subtly implies that certain model architectures might be more robust than others.  For example, the \"learned gradient descent approach\" seemed more resistant to attacks than direct inversion methods. This aligns with research in image classification that explores architecture design as a means of improving adversarial robustness.\n\n*   **Ill-posed Problems:** The paper suggests that networks solving inherently ill-posed problems (like blind deconvolution) might be more vulnerable. This *could* be relevant to image classification if certain classification tasks are considered more \"ill-posed\" than others (e.g., fine-grained classification with subtle differences between classes).\n\n**Specific References with Potential Relevance (and their Dates)**\n\nThe paper cites several works that are relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness.

      "summary": "The paper \"CERTIFIED ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS FOR FREE!\" by Carlini et al. (2023), published within the last two years, addresses the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification?\". The paper's findings are highly relevant and contribute significantly to the current trends in the field. The key aspects are detailed below:\n\n**Core Idea:**\n\n*   The paper introduces a novel approach called **Diffusion Denoised Smoothing (DDS)** to achieve state-of-the-art certified adversarial robustness against \u21132-norm bounded perturbations. The approach uses pre-trained models, specifically combining a pre-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic model with a standard high-accuracy classifier.\n*   This method improves certified robustness *without* fine-tuning or retraining any models.\n\n**Key Findings and Results:**\n\n*   **State-of-the-art Certified Robustness:** DDS achieves significantly better certified robustness results compared to previous methods. Specifically, it achieves **71% certified accuracy on ImageNet** under adversarial perturbations constrained to an \u21132 norm of \u03b5 = 0.5. This is a **14 percentage point improvement** over prior certified state-of-the-art and a **30 percentage point improvement** over denoised smoothing.\n*   **ImageNet:** Achieves state-of-the-art \u21132 robustness on ImageNet.\n*   **CIFAR-10:** Achieves state-of-the-art \u21132 robustness on CIFAR-10.\n*   **Off-the-shelf Models:** The method relies exclusively on pre-trained diffusion models and image classifiers *without* the need to train custom denoisers or specialized robust classifiers.\n*   **Performance at different noise magnitudes:** The benefits of using diffusion models for denoising is most significant at smaller distortions (small \u03b5), while at higher distortions the performance decreased.\n*   **One-Shot Denoising:** The paper demonstrates that using a diffusion model for \"one-shot\" denoising (applying the denoiser once for a fixed noise level) outperforms iterative denoising approaches and existing models. The iterative process tends to hallucinate details not faithful to the original image.\n*   **Training on Diverse Noise Levels:** Models trained on a range of noise levels generalize better for one-shot denoising than models trained on a single noise level. This suggests that the standard diffusion model training regime inherently yields more robust denoising capabilities.\n*   **Advanced Deterministic Multi-Step Sampler:** The paper shows promising results with multi-step diffusion, which can beat one-shot denoising when used with an advanced deterministic sampler (EDM sampler).\n*   **Finetuning:** While the method is designed to work out-of-the-box, finetuning the final classifer further improves performance.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   **Denoised Smoothing Instantiation:** The defense instantiates the denoised smoothing approach of Salman et al. (2020). After perturbing an input with Gaussian noise, the defense applies a denoiser model and then a classifier.\n*   **Diffusion Models as Denoisers:** The core idea is to use state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models as the denoiser. These models are excellent at recovering high-quality denoised inputs from inputs perturbed with Gaussian noise.\n*   **Mapping between Noise Models:** The paper provides the equation to map between the noise model required by randomized smoothing and the noise model used within diffusion models.\n*   **Datasets & Models:** The paper conducts experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, using specific pre-trained diffusion models and classifiers.\n    *   CIFAR-10: A 50M-parameter diffusion model from Nichol & Dhariwal (2021) and an 87M-parameter ViT-B/16 model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) pretrained on ImageNet-21k and finetuned on CIFAR-10.

(2020) and compares against the custom denoisers trained in that work.\n*   The paper addresses and extends the observations from Lee (2021) regarding the connection between randomized smoothing and diffusion models.\n\n**Trends Indicated by the Paper:**\n\n1.  **Leveraging Pre-trained Generative Models for Robustness:** The trend of utilizing powerful, pre-trained generative models (specifically diffusion models) as a core component in achieving adversarial robustness. This shifts away from training specialized robust classifiers from scratch.\n2.  **Denoising-Based Defenses:**  The continued exploration and refinement of denoising-based defenses, particularly in the context of certified robustness.  The paper shows that denoising can be highly effective when combined with appropriate generative models.\n3.  **Certified Robustness via Randomized Smoothing:**  The paper demonstrates that randomized smoothing remains a relevant and powerful technique for certifying robustness. The approach makes randomized smoothing more effective by improving the denoising component.\n4.  **Emphasis on Practicality:** The paper emphasizes the importance of using readily available, off-the-shelf models to achieve robustness. This makes the approach more accessible and easier to implement.\n5. **One-shot denoising techniques:** Use a single pass of a diffusion model denoiser instead of multiple passes.\n6. **Training on Diverse Noise Levels:** Training on a range of noise levels when using diffusion models yields more robust results.\n\nIn summary, this paper demonstrates a significant advancement in certified adversarial robustness for image classification by effectively leveraging pre-trained diffusion models and randomized smoothing. The paper's findings highlight the potential of using generative models in defense strategies and contribute to the ongoing trend of developing practical and effective methods for robust deep learning."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper, focusing on answering the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Trend: Randomized Smoothing with Anisotropic Noise Distributions**\n\nThe core trend presented in this paper is an advancement in *certified* adversarial robustness using *randomized smoothing*, specifically by moving away from isotropic (uniform) noise distributions to *anisotropic* (pixel-wise adaptive) noise distributions. This means the amount and nature of the noise added to an image during the smoothing process is not the same for every pixel but is tailored based on the input.\n\n**Key Concepts and Contributions of the Paper (relevant as a trend):**\n\n*   **Anisotropic Randomized Smoothing (ARS):** The paper proposes a novel randomized smoothing method that applies different noise distributions to different data dimensions (e.g., image pixels). This is in contrast to existing methods that use fixed, identical noise distributions for all pixels and inputs.\n\n*   **Pixel-wise Noise Distributions:** ARS aims to ensure provable robustness by using pixel-wise noise distributions, adapting the noise based on the characteristics of each pixel in the input image.\n\n*   **Noise Generator (CNN-based):**  A key component is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based \"Noise Generator.\"  This CNN *learns* to efficiently fine-tune the pixel-wise noise distributions (means and variances) for each pixel in each input. This is a significant step towards making randomized smoothing more adaptive and effective.\n\n*   **Improved Certified Accuracy and Radii:**  The paper claims that ARS leads to:\n\n    *   Higher certified accuracy compared to state-of-the-art randomized smoothing methods. (e.g., up to 32.9% on CIFAR10 and 20.6% on ImageNet).\n    *   Larger certified radii.  (Certified radius improvement from 1.10 to 2.96 on CIFAR10 and from 1.92 to 3.73 on ImageNet when certified accuracy is fixed at 20%).\n\n*   **Enhanced Robustness Against Pre-Perturbing Attacks:**  The paper also highlights the enhanced robustness of ARS against attacks where the input image is perturbed *before* the randomized smoothing and certification process.  The anisotropic noise is shown to mitigate the effects of malicious perturbations better than isotropic methods.\n\n**How This Relates to Adversarial Robustness Trends (in the last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Shift Towards Certified Robustness:** The paper firmly sits within the trend of *certified* adversarial robustness. This is a move beyond *empirical* defenses, which are often broken by new attacks.  Certified robustness provides mathematical guarantees of a model's resistance to adversarial perturbations within a defined boundary.  This is a critical trend as practitioners need assurances, not just hopeful defenses.\n\n2.  **Randomized Smoothing as a Viable Certification Technique:** Randomized smoothing has emerged as a leading approach to achieve certified robustness, particularly because it can be applied to *any* arbitrary classifier.  This makes it more flexible than methods that rely on specific neural network architectures (e.g., ReLU-based networks).\n\n3.  **Adaptive Noise is Key:** The trend of using *adaptive*, data-dependent noise is crucial.  Earlier randomized smoothing methods used fixed noise distributions. This paper, along with the cited work of (Alfarra et al., 2020), shows a move towards optimizing the noise distribution based on the input data. This paper goes even further by adapting the noise at the *pixel level*. (Alfarra et al., 2020) proproses to optimize the variance of the noise distribution for each input to provide a data-dependent randomized smoothing.\n\n4.  **Addressing the Weaknesses of Standard Randomized Smoothing:** The introduction explicitly calls out the limitations of existing randomized smoothing techniques:\n    * Ignores heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions (pixels)\n    * Cannot provide optimal protection for all inputs\n\n5.  **Defense Against Pre-Perturbation is Emerging:** The paper *explicitly* identifies and addresses a weakness in randomized smoothing: its susceptibility to adversarial examples crafted *before* the smoothing process. This is a relatively new consideration, making the \"enhanced robustness against pre-perturbing attack\" a notable contribution and indication of a developing trend.\n\n**Relevant Papers from the Last 2 Years (Cited in the paper):**\n\nThe following cited papers are within the last 2 years and contribute to the trends discussed above:\n\n*   **(Croce & Hein, 2020):** Reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness with an ensemble of diverse parameter-free attacks. (Emphasizes the need for robust evaluation of defenses.)\n*   **(Sun et al., 2020):**  Towards robust lidar-based perception in autonomous driving: General black-box adversarial sensor attack and countermeasures.

Core Focus of the Paper (and its Relevance):**\n\n*   **Generalizability of Adversarial Robustness:** This paper investigates whether adversarial robustness (both empirical and certified) generalizes to *unseen domains* \u2013 a setting called Domain Generalization (DG). This is highly relevant as it examines robustness in more realistic, non-IID conditions. The core question is: if a model is robust to adversarial attacks in a training environment, will it remain robust when deployed in a different, unseen environment? This is a critical issue for real-world deployment.\n\n**II. Types of Robustness Studied:**\n\n*   **Empirical Robustness:** Achieved via Adversarial Training (AT) methods like PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) augmentation and TRADES. These techniques involve training the model on adversarial examples to make it more resistant.\n\n*   **Certified Robustness:** Provides *guarantees* about the model's robustness within a specific region around an input. The paper uses Randomized Smoothing (RS) and DeformRS to achieve certified robustness. RS smooths the classifier by averaging predictions over Gaussian noise. DeformRS extends this to geometric transformations.\n\n**III. Key Findings and Trends (Relevant to the Research Question):**\n\n*   **Generalization of Robustness:** Both empirical and certified robustness *do* generalize to unseen domains to some extent. This suggests that efforts to improve robustness are not entirely wasted when the model encounters new environments.\n\n*   **Empirical Robustness and Domain Generalization:**\n\n    *   **Adversarial Training doesn't always improve clean accuracy in the target domain (Q1).** This is a *crucial finding*. Unlike transfer learning (where robust training helps), simply making a model robust in the source domain *doesn't guarantee* better performance on clean (non-adversarial) data in the target domain. *Trend:* This highlights a need to rethink how adversarial training is applied in domain generalization scenarios.\n    *   **Higher source robustness correlates with higher target robustness (Q2).** Even though robustness decreases when moving to a new domain, improving robustness in the training domain still leads to a more robust model in the target domain. *Trend:* Reinforces the importance of continued research in improving adversarial training techniques.\n    *   **The robustness-accuracy trade-off generalizes (Q3).** More robust models tend to have lower standard accuracy, *even in unseen domains*. *Trend:* This signifies the continued challenge of balancing robustness and accuracy in machine learning.\n\n*   **Certified Robustness and Domain Generalization:**\n\n    *   **Certified robustness generalizes to unseen domains (Q4).** Randomized smoothing provides a base level of certification, which is important for security-critical applications.  *Trend:* Indicates that certified robustness techniques can be useful even in dynamic environments.\n    *   **Stronger architectures improve target certified accuracy (Q5).** Using a more powerful backbone (ViT-Base instead of ResNet-50) leads to higher certified robustness in the target domain. *Trend:* Implies that advancements in general model architectures also contribute to better robustness.\n    *   **Visual similarity doesn't predict robustness generalization (Q6).** Measured by FID and R-FID, visual similarity between source and target domains doesn't correlate well with how well robustness generalizes. *Trend:* Suggests that current metrics for assessing domain similarity may not be adequate for predicting robustness generalization, calling for the development of new, more relevant metrics.\n\n*   **Real-world Medical Application (CAMELYON17):**\n\n    *   Adversarial training can maintain high clean accuracy in medical image DG (unlike some other datasets). Pixel perturbations are somewhat similar to domain shifts in medical images.\n    *   Certified robustness generalizes to unseen hospitals.  *Trend:* Shows the potential and need for robust AI in healthcare.\n    *   However, the gap in certified robustness between source and target domains in the medical setting is larger than in other datasets (e.g., PACS). *Trend:* Highlights a need for more research to bridge the source-target gap specifically in sensitive applications like medical imaging.\n\n**IV.

      "relevancy": "The paper introduces DiffuseMix, a data augmentation technique using diffusion models, to enhance resilience against adversarial attacks, which is directly relevant to the research question. It was published in the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper and extract the information relevant to adversarial robustness in image classification, focusing on the last 2 years.\n\n**Core Argument of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper introduces DIFFUSEMIX, a novel data augmentation technique using diffusion models to improve the generalization and robustness of deep neural networks, including adversarial robustness. It addresses the limitations of existing image-mixing augmentation methods by concatenating a portion of the original image with a generated counterpart (using tailored conditional prompts) and blending the hybrid image with a fractal pattern.\n\n**Key Findings Related to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   **DIFFUSEMIX Enhances Adversarial Robustness:** The paper explicitly states and demonstrates improved adversarial robustness compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) augmentation methods.\n*   **Evaluation Metric:** The method's adversarial robustness is evaluated using FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) error rates on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet-200 datasets.  This is a standard approach for measuring a model's resilience to adversarial attacks.\n*   **Superior Performance:**  Table 4 provides quantitative results:\n    *   On CIFAR-100, DIFFUSEMIX achieves an FGSM error rate of 17.38%, which is lower than all compared methods, including PuzzleMix (19.62%).\n    *   On Tiny-ImageNet-200, DIFFUSEMIX achieves an FGSM error rate of 34.53%, again outperforming PuzzleMix (36.52%).\n*   **Structural Diversity and Overfitting:** The blending of self-similarity fractals is cited as a mechanism for increasing structural diversity and preventing overfitting on generated content, leading to performance improvements including adversarial robustness.  This links a specific component of their method to the observed benefits.\n\n**How DIFFUSEMIX Works (Relevant for Understanding the Robustness Gains):**\n\n1.  **Generation:**  A pre-trained diffusion model (InstructPix2Pix) generates an augmented counterpart image based on the input image and a textual prompt. The prompts are filter-like global visual effects that modify the image without drastically altering its structure.\n2.  **Concatenation:**  A portion of the original image is concatenated with the generated image using a binary mask to create a hybrid image. This preserves key semantics from the original image while incorporating diversity from the generated image.\n3.  **Fractal Blending:**  A randomly selected fractal image is blended into the hybrid image. This increases structural diversity, avoiding overfitting and contributing to adversarial robustness (as per the paper's argument).\n\n**Comparison to Other Methods (Adversarial Robustness Context):**\n\nThe paper compares DIFFUSEMIX to other augmentation techniques, including:\n\n*   Mixup\n*   CutMix\n*   AugMix\n*   SaliencyMix\n*   Manifold Mixup\n*   PuzzleMix\n*   Co-Mixup\n*   GuidedMixup\n*   PixMix\n*   YOCO\n\nIt demonstrates quantitatively (Table 4) that DIFFUSEMIX achieves lower FGSM error rates than these methods, suggesting a greater level of adversarial robustness.\n\n**Specific Ablation Studies and Design Choices Supporting Adversarial Robustness Claims:**\n\n*   Table 7 (Ablation Study): This table highlights the importance of each component (Generation, Concatenation, Fractal Blending) of DIFFUSEMIX, showing that removing any of them reduces performance, suggesting each contributes to the overall benefits, including those related to adversarial robustness. Specifically, the fractal blending step is intended to increase the diversity of augmented training data, thus improving generalization and adversarial robustness.\n*   Masking study (Table 9) demonstrates that the best performance is achieved when both horizontal and vertical masks are used along with random flipping between the positions of input and generated images.\n*   Prompt Selection Discussion (Section 3): It is critical to use \"filter-like\" prompts so that the augmented images are suitable for training.\n\n**Limitations Acknowledged by the Authors:**\n\n*   **Prompt Sensitivity:** The reliance on textual prompts for image generation means that poorly chosen prompts can lead to unrealistic results.  They address this by using a set of \"filter-like\" prompts suitable for a wide range of images.\n*   **Computational Overhead:** Generating images with diffusion models introduces additional computational costs.  The authors argue that this is a small price to pay and can be mitigated by generating and storing augmented images offline.\n\n**Additional Notes from Supplementary Materials:**\n\n*  Table 17, in the supplementary material, directly addresses safety measures, showcasing that DIFFUSEMIX outperforms SOTA methods, including PixMix, on 4 out of 5 safety metrics on the CIFAR-100 dataset.\n*   Section 1 & Table 10 discusses the fractal blending ratio and it's impact on overall performance.\n*   Section 2 discusses augmentation overhead and presents Figure 6 with DIFFUSEMIX providing a good trade-off between performance and augmentation overhead.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness, Last 2 Years):**\n\n*   **Data Augmentation is Key:** The paper reinforces the idea that data augmentation remains a crucial strategy for improving adversarial robustness.\n*   **Diffusion Models are Emerging:** It highlights the growing interest in using diffusion models for data augmentation and shows a specific way to leverage them effectively for adversarial robustness.  It cites other recent papers ([1], [40] in the references) exploring this direction.\n*   **Hybrid Approach:** DIFFUSEMIX's combination of original images, diffusion-generated content, and fractal blending represents a trend toward more sophisticated and carefully designed augmentation pipelines. The paper shows that simply using diffusion-generated images isn't enough; the mixing strategy is critical.\n*   **Focus on Structural Diversity:**  The emphasis on increasing structural diversity through fractal blending connects to the broader trend of seeking augmentations that go beyond simple pixel-level transformations.\n*   **Evaluation:** The use of FGSM error rates, is in line with standard evaluation practices in the field.\n\n**In summary, this paper contributes to the trend of using diffusion models for data augmentation to improve adversarial robustness in image classification. It introduces a novel mixing strategy (DIFFUSEMIX) and demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing FGSM error rates compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.**"

While the application is in medical imaging, the underlying method and discussion of adversarial robustness are relevant. It was published in the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the information from the provided paper relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Relevance Assessment:**\n\nWhile the primary focus of the paper is on generating realistic counterfactual images using diffusion models in ophthalmology, it does delve into the *use of adversarially robust classifiers* to guide the diffusion process.  Therefore, it provides relevant information to the research question, albeit not as its central theme. The paper was written in 2023, so it falls within the last 2 years.\n\n**Specific Information Extraction:**\n\n1.  **Adversarial Robustness as a Key Component:**\n\n    *   The paper explicitly states that \"using a diffusion model in combination with an *adversarially robust classifier* trained on retinal disease classification tasks enables the generation of highly realistic counterfactuals...\"  This highlights that adversarial robustness is considered an important factor for generating meaningful counterfactuals.\n    *   It argues that adversarially robust classifiers \"encode salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the diffusion model to depict disease signs or remove disease-related lesions in a realistic way.\"  This suggests that the *gradients* of robust classifiers are more informative and perceptually aligned than those of standard classifiers.\n\n2.  **Why Adversarial Robustness Matters for Counterfactuals:**\n\n    *   The paper contrasts plain (standard) classifiers with adversarially robust classifiers, stating that plain classifiers often produce gradients that are \"not perceptually aligned with the features of a particular class.\" This can lead to counterfactuals that are visually similar to the original image or contain imperceptible changes, which are not useful for explanation.\n    *   Adversarially robust models, on the other hand, have \"strong generative properties\" and are \"more effective in guiding diffusion models towards generating meaningful features for a target class.\" This advantage stems from their training, which exposes them to adversarial attacks. The model is therefore able to make small changes to the image to alter the classification.\n\n3.  **Adversarial Training Method Used:**\n\n    *   The paper mentions using TRADES (Theoretically principled Trade-off between Robustness and Accuracy) algorithm for adversarial training [23]. This is a specific technique used to improve the robustness of the classifier.\n\n    *   The TRADES loss function is explicitly provided (Equation 6), showing the trade-off between the standard cross-entropy loss and a term that penalizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted probabilities for the original image and its adversarial perturbation.\n\n    *   Specific values for the TRADES parameters are given: \u03b2 = 6, \u03b5 = 0.01 for fundus robust classifiers and \u03b5 = 0.5 for the OCT classifier, and p = 2 (referring to \u21132 norm). These are important implementation details.\n\n4.  **Cone Projection:**\n\n    *   The paper also discusses a technique called \"cone projection\" as a way to combine the benefits of both plain and robust classifiers. Since robust classifiers can have lower accuracy than plain classifiers, the cone projection method projects the gradients of the robust model onto a cone centered around the gradients of the plain model. This aims to leverage the stronger generative properties of the robust model while maintaining higher accuracy.\n\n5.  **Experimental Setup and Results related to Robust Classifiers:**\n\n    *   The paper trains both plain and adversarially robust ResNet-50 models for retinal fundus images (binary and multi-class settings) and OCT scans.\n\n    *   Table 2 shows a comparison of the accuracy and balanced accuracy of plain and robust classifiers for both fundus images and OCT scans.  The results demonstrate the expected trade-off: the robust classifiers have slightly lower accuracy than the plain classifiers.\n    *   Figure 4 visually compares counterfactuals generated using plain models, robust models, and cone projection. It shows that robust models produce more realistic changes.\n\n6.  **Specifics on Implementation:**\n\n    *  The models used for the adversarial training were ResNet-50 models\n    *  The optimizer was an SGD optimizer\n    *  The learning rate was 0.01 with a cosine learning rate schedule\n    *  The plain fundus classifiers were initialized with weights from ImageNet pre-trained models\n    *  The robust fundus classifiers were initialized with weights from a robustly pre-trained ImageNet model [25].\n    *  All OCT classifiers were initialized with random weights.\n\n**Summary of Trends (Based on this Paper):**\n\nFrom this paper, the trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (specifically in the context of generating counterfactuals) include:\n\n*   **Adversarially Robust Classifiers are Useful for Guiding Generative Models:** The paper reinforces the idea that adversarially robust classifiers have more informative gradients, making them valuable for guiding generative models like diffusion models to create realistic and meaningful counterfactual images.\n*   **TRADES is a Popular Adversarial Training Technique:** The use of TRADES shows this algorithm's continued relevance in achieving robustness.\n*   **Combining Plain and Robust Models:**  Techniques like cone projection are being explored to balance the trade-off between robustness and accuracy, attempting to get the best of both worlds.\n*   **Focus on Meaningful Perturbations, Not Just Imperceptible Ones:** The goal is not just to fool the classifier with minimal, imperceptible noise (as in a standard adversarial attack), but to generate *meaningful* changes that are relevant to the target class and human-interpretable.\n\n**Limitations & Considerations:**\n\n*   The paper's primary focus is not *directly* on advancing the state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness.  It uses adversarial robustness as a tool to achieve realistic counterfactual generation.\n*   The trends identified are specific to the application of adversarial robustness within the context of counterfactual image generation, particularly in medical imaging.\n*   The paper cites other works on adversarial robustness, but does not provide an exhaustive survey of the field."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the paper, focusing on the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper and Relevance**\n\n*   The paper primarily addresses adversarial robustness in *vision-language (VL) models* specifically for the *image-text retrieval (ITR)* task, NOT image classification.\n*   It is positioned against the backdrop of existing defense strategies that focus on *zero-shot image classification* within VL models. The authors argue that these strategies are insufficient for ITR due to the multimodal nature of the attacks (image and text) and the many-to-many (N:N) relationships between images and text.\n*   Therefore, while it touches on adversarial robustness, its direct relevance to *image classification* is limited. It is more relevant to multimodal robustness.\n\n**Key Points Relevant to Adversarial Robustness Trends (with Caveats):**\n\nBecause the paper focuses on ITR, the relevance to image classification is indirect. However, here are some potentially relevant trends that *might* be applicable or adaptable to image classification:\n\n1.  **Data Augmentation Strategies:**\n    *   **Many-to-Many Augmentation:** The central theme is leveraging the N:N relationships to enhance robustness. The core idea is that training with diverse, augmented image-text pairs prevents overfitting to specific 1:1 pairings in the training data, making the model more robust to adversarial examples.\n    *   **Intra-modal Augmentation:**  The paper explores intra-modal augmentations such as \"Easy Data Augmentation (EDA)\" for text (synonym replacement, random insertion, deletion, swap) and random resize cropping and RandAugment for images. The findings suggest that basic text augmentation is more effective than basic image augmentation in the ITR context.\n    *   **Cross-modal Augmentation:** This involves using one modality (e.g., text) to generate augmentations for the other (e.g., image) and vice-versa. The paper used Stable Diffusion (text-to-image) and ground truth captions as cross-modal augmentation.  The key finding is that the *alignment* of these augmented pairs is crucial; poorly aligned augmentations can degrade performance.\n    *   **N:N-CoA framework:** Based on leveraging both image and text augmentations to generate diverse and well-aligned many-to-many (N:N) image-text pairs.\n\n2.  **Adversarial Training:**\n    *   The paper uses adversarial training as the *de facto* defense strategy.  It builds upon existing adversarial training methods like Text-guided Contrastive Adversarial training (TeCoA) and PMG-AFT, but extends them to handle the complexities of ITR.\n    *   The method involves generating adversarial examples (perturbed images and/or text) and training the model to be robust against them.\n    *   The paper finds that N:N augmentation and adversarial training (N:N-CoA) improves the performance against Co-Attack and SGA attacks.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:**  Adversarial training is a well-established technique in image classification, so this is not necessarily a *new* trend.\n\n3.  **Importance of Alignment:**\n    *   A recurring theme is the importance of *alignment* between augmented image-text pairs. If augmentations create pairs that are semantically inconsistent or poorly aligned, the defense strategy can backfire. This suggests that simply adding more data is not enough; the quality and relevance of the augmented data matter significantly.\n    *   The paper mentions alignment score, S\u03a6,\u03a8(I, T ) (same as Sec. 3.1), which represents the cosine similarity between the embeddings of the image and text.\n\n**Specific Methods and Techniques:**\n\n*   **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining):**  The paper focuses on defending CLIP against adversarial attacks. CLIP learns a joint embedding space for images and texts, and the attacks aim to manipulate the similarity score in this space.\n*   **Attacks Used:** The paper evaluates defenses against Co-Attack (multimodal) and SGA (multimodal) attacks.  It also mentions PGD (image attack) and BERT-attack (text attack) in the appendix. These are used to test the robustness of the models.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Recall@k (R@k) is used to evaluate the performance of image-to-text retrieval (I2T) and text-to-image retrieval (T2I).\n\n**Limitations Acknowledged by the Authors:**\n\n*   **Computational Cost:** Generating augmented data points, especially using generative models, can be expensive.\n*   **Limited Scope:** The evaluation is focused on ITR. The effectiveness of the proposed framework on other VL tasks needs further exploration.\n\n**Papers Cited (Relevant for Trends in the last 2 years):**\n\nHere's a list of the cited papers that fall within the last two years (2022-2024) and may be useful for further investigation (focusing on those that seem more broadly relevant to adversarial robustness, not just ITR):\n\n*   **[9] S.

      "summary": "Okay, I've reviewed the provided paper and extracted the information relevant to your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**It is important to note that the provided paper primarily focuses on *data poisoning attacks* in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which is a different, though related, area than *adversarial robustness for image classification*.  Data poisoning involves manipulating the training data, while adversarial robustness often deals with crafting inputs (adversarial examples) that fool a trained model during inference.**\n\nThat said, I will extract any information that could be loosely connected to the research question.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the relevant information, keeping in mind the ITS context:\n\n**I. General Overview of Data Poisoning Attacks (DPA) & Relevance to Image Classification (Limited):**\n\n*   **Data Poisoning Definition:** The paper defines data poisoning attacks (DPAs) as adversaries injecting malicious perturbations into a dataset, leading to inaccurate results in offline learning and real-time decision-making processes. This can affect various aspects of ITS, including traffic prediction, control, safety, and human mobility analysis.\n*   **DPA in ITS:** DPAs in ITS are a growing concern because of the increasing reliance on data-driven systems. The paper emphasizes that DPAs in transportation, including attacks on image data, present unique challenges.\n*   **DPAs vs. Evasion Attacks:** The paper notes that terms like \"evasion attacks\" are sometimes used for data attacks related to real-time decisions, while \"data poisoning\" often refers to attacks on the training data.  In the paper's terminology, \"data poisoning\" is used broadly to encompass attacks that manipulate input data, including both training and inference stages.\n*   **Motivation for DPAs in ITS:** Attackers may target ITS to disrupt traffic flow, steal sensitive data, gain financially (e.g., exploiting tolling systems), engage in cyberterrorism, or sabotage infrastructure.\n*   **Review Scope:** The survey focuses on DPA models against primary ITS data, including data supporting individual road users, V2X communication, and the infrastructure. It discusses application scenarios that enable staging such attacks.\n\n**II. Mentions of Image Data and Computer Vision (Most Relevant Section):**\n\n*   **Attacks on Camera-Based Systems:**  The paper explicitly mentions that computer vision systems, particularly those using cameras, are vulnerable to attacks. For instance, cameras are sensitive to blinding attacks. Deep-learning (DL)-based computer vision systems deployed on vehicles can be attacked by feeding adversarial traffic signs into the training dataset.\n*   **Adversarial Patches:** The paper cites DiPalma et al. (2021) who devised an adversarial patch attack targeting camera-based obstacle detection. A designed adversarial patch is affixed to the rear of a box truck. The experiment showed that the vehicle under attack failed in detecting the box truck with the adversarial patch and thus collided into it.\n*   **Spoofing attack on camera:** The paper mentions spoofing attacks on cameras, resulting in label flapping during the training stage.\n*   **Attacks targeting vehicle perception:** The paper mentions research exposing the vulnerabilities of sensors supporting vehicle perception to DPAs, where attacks on cameras and vehicles\u2019 computer vision algorithms are prevalent.\n*    **Attacks on LIDAR:** The paper mentions LIDAR as a sensor susceptible to spoofing and relay attacks. Yang et al. (2021) proposed an adversarial attack against DL models responsible for object detection using raw 3-D points from a LiDAR in a CAV.\n*   **Backdoor attacks:** Wang et al (2021) explored the backdooring of deep reinforcement learning-based AV controllers. The methodology involves trigger design based on established traffic physics principles. The triggers encompass malicious actions such as vehicle deceleration and acceleration, capable of inducing stop-and-go traffic waves (congestion attacks) or causing the CAV to accelerate into the vehicle in front (insurance attacks). These attacks can be maliciously activated to provoke crashes or congestion when the corresponding triggers are detected.\n\n**III. Data Sources and Targets:**\n\n*   **Data Supporting Individual Users (Vehicles):**  Attacks can target vehicle localization (GNSS spoofing, attacks on SLAM), vehicle perception (attacks on cameras, LiDAR, millimeter radar), and vehicle planning & control.\n*   **V2X Communications:** Attacks can target V2V, V2I, and V2N communications, compromising data confidentiality and integrity.\n*   **Infrastructure Data:** Attacks can target traffic management and control systems, data collection and analysis processes, and safety enhancement mechanisms.\n\n**IV. Attack Strategies (General Framework):**\n\nThe paper outlines a general framework for studying DPAs in ITS, which includes:\n\n*   **Attack Goal:**  Influencing individual users, local corridors, or the entire network.\n*   **Attacker's Knowledge:**  White-box (complete knowledge of the system), Black-box (no or little knowledge), or Grey-box (partial knowledge).\n*   **Attacker's Capability:** Manipulating the training data, manipulating real-time data, altering features, or flipping labels.\n*   **Attack Strategy:** Optimization-based, dynamic system-based, or using complex data-driven models.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on the last 2 years:\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper primarily investigates the *vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) systems to data poisoning attacks* in the context of histopathological image classification (specifically, skin lesion classification).  It does *not* directly address the broader trends in adversarial robustness *outside* of this specific FL and data poisoning scenario. The paper focuses on label flipping as an attack vector within a federated learning context for histopathological image classification.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness (Specifically, Data Poisoning in FL):**\n\n*   **Data Poisoning as an Adversarial Attack:** The core contribution lies in analyzing how a malicious client in a federated learning setup can degrade the global model's performance by injecting poisoned data (specifically, flipped labels). This is a form of adversarial attack targeting the training process itself, not the model's input during inference.\n*   **Label Flipping Attack:** The paper implements a specific type of data poisoning attack where a malicious client intentionally flips the labels of a subset of its training data before sending model updates to the aggregator. The impact of varying percentages of label flipping on the global model's accuracy is then evaluated.\n*   **Impact on Model Accuracy:** The results show that increasing the percentage of flipped labels introduced by the malicious client generally leads to a decrease in the global model's accuracy. This demonstrates the vulnerability of FL systems to this type of attack.\n\n**Specific Details and Experimental Setup:**\n\n*   **Federated Learning Setup:**\n    *   The FL system is simulated using the TensorFlow library in Python.\n    *   The setup involves 10 participating \"hospitals\" (clients) and one aggregator.\n    *   Independent and identically distributed (IID) data is used (although the vulnerability to non-IID data poisoning is a related concern in FL, it's not the primary focus here).\n*   **Deep Neural Network Architecture:**\n    *   A multilayer perceptron (MLP) model is used for image classification. The MLP has three fully connected (dense) layers with 200 units each. ReLU activation is used in the hidden layers, and softmax in the output layer.\n*   **Dataset:**\n    *   HAM10000 dataset of skin lesion images (10,015 samples, 7 classes).\n*   **Training:**\n    *   Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer.\n    *   100 communication rounds (federated learning rounds).\n    *   Categorical cross-entropy loss function.\n    *   Accuracy as the evaluation metric.\n*   **Malicious Client Implementation:**\n    1.  Select *k* samples from the labeled dataset where *k* is the *p* percentage of the selected labels.\n    2.  For each *k* replace the skin-lesion class with an alternate random skin-lesion class.\n    3.  Repeat step 2 for all *k*.\n    4.  Train the local model *Ai* on the substituted label.\n    5.  Send the trained model to the aggregator for Fedaveraging.\n\n**Key Results:**\n\n*   **Baseline Accuracy:** Before label flipping, the federated learning model achieves an accuracy of approximately 67.099% on the HAM10000 dataset using the specified MLP architecture and training parameters. A centralized ML model was created as well, achieving a 67.099% accuracy.\n*   **Accuracy Degradation due to Label Flipping:** As the percentage of flipped labels increases (from 2% to 20%), the global model's accuracy generally decreases. The performance of individual classes is also negatively affected, with some classes showing precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.00 after the attack.\n\n**Limitations (Regarding Broader Trends in Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   **Limited Scope:** This paper provides a *specific case study* of a data poisoning attack in a *federated learning setting*.  It does *not* offer a comprehensive overview of the latest techniques for improving adversarial robustness in image classification in general.\n*   **Specific Attack Vector:** The focus is solely on *label flipping*. Many other types of adversarial attacks exist (e.g., adversarial examples crafted to fool a trained model at inference time), and this paper doesn't address defenses against them.\n*   **Federated Learning Focus:** This paper is highly specific to the FL paradigm. While data poisoning is a concern in centralized learning too, the FL setting introduces unique challenges related to distributed data, client trustworthiness, and communication efficiency.\n\n**In summary:** This paper is valuable for understanding the vulnerability of federated learning systems to data poisoning attacks, specifically label flipping.  However, it *does not* provide a broad overview of the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification in general. To answer your research question comprehensively, you would need to consult other papers focusing on adversarial example generation techniques (e.g., FGSM, PGD), defense mechanisms (e.g., adversarial training, defensive distillation, input sanitization), and robustness evaluation metrics in *non-federated* and *federated* settings.\n\nThe provided references in the paper offer a starting point for exploring related work, but note that some references (e.g., [2]) may be slightly older than the 2-year timeframe specified in your question and would need to be supplemented with more recent publications.  Also, the paper's references are primarily related to federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, and skin lesion classification, rather than *general* adversarial robustness techniques."

      "summary": "Okay, I will extract the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** PROVABLY RELIABLE CONFORMAL PREDICTION SETS IN THE PRESENCE OF DATA POISONING\n\n**Key Information Extracted:**\n\n1.  **Problem Addressed:** The paper focuses on adversarial robustness in image classification, specifically in the context of *data poisoning attacks* against conformal prediction. Conformal prediction is a framework for uncertainty quantification, ensuring prediction sets cover the ground truth with a specified probability. The paper addresses the vulnerability of conformal prediction to data poisoning where adversaries manipulate training and calibration data.\n\n2.  **Timeframe Relevance:**  While the paper itself doesn't explicitly state a 2022-2024 focus, it references several papers published within that timeframe, suggesting the research is current and addresses recent trends. Specifically, the related works section cites papers published in 2023 and 2024, which demonstrates the recent focus of the work.\n\n3.  **Approach (Reliable Prediction Sets - RPS):** The paper proposes a novel method called Reliable Prediction Sets (RPS) to enhance the reliability of conformal prediction under data poisoning. RPS consists of two main components:\n\n    *   **Smoothed Score Functions:** These functions aggregate predictions from classifiers trained on distinct partitions of the training data to improve robustness against training poisoning. The partitioning uses a hash function to ensure order invariance.  A smoothed score function s(x, y) is defined that counts the number of classifiers voting for a class y given a sample x.\n        *   Training data is partitioned into *kt* disjoint sets.\n        *   Separate classifiers (*fi*) are trained on each partition.\n        *   The score function counts classifiers \"voting\" for a class *y* given a sample *x*.\n    *   **Majority Prediction Sets:**  Multiple prediction sets are calibrated on disjoint subsets of the calibration data, and a majority voting mechanism is used to combine them, improving robustness against calibration poisoning.\n        *   Calibration data is partitioned into *kc* disjoint sets.\n        *   Prediction sets are computed separately on each partition.\n        *   These sets are merged using majority voting.\n\n4.  **Type of Adversarial Attack Considered:** The paper explicitly deals with *data poisoning attacks*, where adversaries can modify, add, or delete data points from both training and calibration datasets (both feature poisoning and label flipping). This contrasts with *evasion attacks* which perturb only test data.\n\n5.  **Related Work:**  The paper distinguishes itself from existing literature in the following ways:\n\n    *   **Prediction Set Ensembles:**  While ensembles of prediction sets exist, this work focuses on improving reliability specifically under *worst-case training and calibration poisoning*.\n    *   **Conformal Prediction under Evasion:** Existing works on reliable conformal prediction primarily address *evasion attacks* (perturbations of test data).  This paper tackles the less explored area of *poisoning attacks*.  It references techniques like randomized smoothing used against evasion attacks. It distinguishes its work by specifically addressing poisoning threat models. Citations include Cohen et al. (2019), Gendler et al. (2022), Yan et al. (2024), Zargarbashi et al. (2024), and Ghosh et al. (2023).\n    *   **Conformal Prediction under Poisoning:**  Existing attempts to improve reliability under poisoning often focus on certifying the conformal guarantee only under *calibration poisoning* or study calibration poisoning *empirically* or under specific label noise. This paper uniquely considers pointwise reliability under a threat model where adversaries can modify, add, or remove data points from *both* training and calibration data. Citations include Park et al. (2023), Zargarbashi et al. (2024), Kang et al. (2024), Einbinder et al. (2022), Penso & Goldberger (2024), and Cauchois et al. (2020).\n    *   **Robustness Certification against Data Poisoning:**  While robustness certification techniques exist for classification under poisoning, they often consider *different threat models, specific training techniques or architectures*. Furthermore, existing approaches guarantee robust classification, but aren't directly applicable to conformal prediction because prediction sets (1) contain multiple classes, and (2) can be manipulated via poisoning during training *and* calibration. Citations include Rosenfeld et al. (2020), Tian et al. (2023), Sosnin et al. (2024), Levine & Feizi (2021), Wang et al. (2022), and Rezaei et al. (2023).\n\n6.  **Provable Guarantees:** The paper provides provable guarantees (certificates) for the reliability of RPS under worst-case data poisoning attacks, including label flipping attacks. These guarantees are pointwise, applying to each prediction set.  The paper derives certificates for reliability, ensuring coverage and size reliability of prediction sets.\n\n7.  **Experimental Validation:**  The approach is experimentally validated on image classification tasks using ResNet models on CIFAR and SVHN datasets.\n\n8. **Evaluation Metrics**\n* Reliability ratios: The ratios of test datapoints whose prediction sets are, according to our worst-case analysis, coverage reliable (classes cannot be removed), size reliable (classes cannot be added), or robust (classes cannot removed or added).\n* Empirical coverage refers to the ratio of datapoints whose prediction sets cover the ground truth label of the test set.\n* The average size of the prediction sets computed on the test set.\n\n**Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Image Classification):**\n\nBased on the extracted information, the paper highlights the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification over the last 2 years:\n\n*   **Focus on Data Poisoning:**  A growing recognition of the importance of robustness against *data poisoning attacks* (manipulation of training data), as opposed to solely focusing on evasion attacks (manipulation of test data). This paper identifies a gap in the literature regarding data poisoning.\n*   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Emphasis on reliable *uncertainty quantification* methods, particularly conformal prediction, to provide prediction sets with coverage guarantees even under adversarial conditions.\n*   **Provable Robustness:**  Desire for *provable guarantees* of robustness, rather than relying solely on empirical evaluations.\n*   **Ensemble Methods and Data Partitioning:**  Use of *ensemble methods* (training multiple classifiers) and *data partitioning* as strategies for mitigating the impact of poisoned data. The paper highlights the trend of partitioning training data and aggregating predictions.\n*   **Pointwise Reliability:**  Moving beyond marginal coverage guarantees to focus on *pointwise reliability*, ensuring that individual prediction sets are robust.\n*   **Trade-offs between Robustness and Utility:** Acknowledgement of the trade-offs between robustness and the utility (size and accuracy) of prediction sets.\n\nIn summary, the paper demonstrates a trend toward addressing more realistic and challenging adversarial scenarios like data poisoning in image classification, with a focus on provable robustness guarantees for uncertainty quantification methods like conformal prediction."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Note:** The paper was submitted in April 2024, so any trends discussed in the paper are up to date as of that time.\n\n**1. Focus on Lipschitz Continuity and Non-Expansive Networks:**\n\n*   The paper highlights the importance of Lipschitz conditions on neural networks for adversarial robustness. It notes that concerns about the stability of neural networks in the face of adversarial examples have been a driving force in recent research.\n*   The core contribution of the paper is the design and analysis of ResNet-styled neural network architectures that are provably non-expansive (1-Lipschitz).  Non-expansiveness is presented as an inductive bias to increase robustness.\n*   The paper connects this approach to the idea of gradient flows in convex potentials, providing a theoretical basis for the stability of the proposed networks.\n\n**2. Spectral Normalization:**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges spectral normalization as a standard technique for constraining the Lipschitz constant of feedforward neural networks.  It cites Miyato et al. (2018) [26] as a reference for this technique.\n*   The paper notes that estimating the true optimal Lipschitz constant of a neural network is computationally hard, which motivates the need for alternative architectures like the one proposed in the paper.\n\n**3. Multi-Class Hinge Loss:**\n\n*   The paper emphasizes that maximizing the margin of a classifier is sensical when combined with constraining the Lipschitz constant.\n*   The paper uses a multi-class hinge loss function in their experiments to train the networks.\n\n**4. Adversarial Training as a Baseline:**\n\n*   The paper includes adversarial training as a baseline comparison. The adversarially trained ResNet (ResNet-AT) demonstrates that explicitly training on adversarial examples can improve robustness.\n*   The training procedure is the same as in normal training using SGD, except that minibatches of clean images are replaced with perturbed images generated using algorithm 3.\n*   The paper acknowledges the increased computational cost of adversarial training since the adversarial minibatches must be regenerated at each iteration.\n\n**5. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) Attacks:**\n\n*   The paper utilizes Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) as the adversarial attack method to evaluate robustness. The Foolbox package is used for implementing the attacks [31].\n*   \u2113[2]-norm constraint is used.\n*   Untargeted attacks are used.\n\n**6. Experimental Results (CIFAR10):**\n\n*   The paper presents a comparison between their proposed non-expansive network (NonExpNet), a standard ResNet, and an adversarially trained ResNet (ResNet-AT) on the CIFAR10 dataset.\n*   **Clean Accuracy:** ResNet > ResNet-AT > NonExpNet\n*   **Robustness (AUC):** ResNet-AT > NonExpNet > ResNet\n*   A key finding is that NonExpNet, trained *without* adversarial examples, exhibits significantly improved robustness compared to a standard ResNet, demonstrating the effectiveness of the non-expansiveness inductive bias.\n*   The NonExpNet performs comparably to adversarially trained ResNets\n*   Difference in AUC between NonExpNet and ResNet-AT (7%) can almost completely be explained by the shift corresponding to the difference in their clean accuracies (6.9%).\n*   It is noted that ResNet can be expected to be at least as expressive as NonExpNet and that the difference in clean accuracy may be explained by the difference in expressiveness.\n\n**7. Adaptive Training:**\n\n*   The paper's proposed \"adaptive approach\" adapts to the operator norm during training to ensure that the bounds are satisfied by splitting each integration interval.\n*   During training, operator norms of linear operators in non-expansive blocks are not fixed, but splitting each integration interval according to Equation (7) ensures that the steps that are taken are small enough to satisfy bounds discussed in section 2.\n\n**8. References to Recent Work:**\n\n*   The paper cites relevant research on Lipschitz neural networks, including work on spectral normalization [26], and methods based on continuous dynamical systems [33, 10, 7].\n*   It mentions connections between deep learning and convex analysis/monotone operator theory [12, 30, 19, 23].\n\n**Summary of Trends:**\n\nBased on this paper, current trends in adversarial robustness for image classification include:\n\n*   **Emphasis on Lipschitz continuity and provable stability:** Moving beyond empirical methods and focusing on network architectures with theoretical guarantees of robustness.\n*   **Exploiting connections to dynamical systems and convex analysis:** Drawing inspiration from these fields to design stable and robust networks.\n*   **Spectral normalization remains a key technique:** Although limitations exist, it's still a widely used method for controlling Lipschitz constants.\n*   **Adaptive Training Methods:** Neural networks are trained by allowing the integration interval to adapt to operator norm by splitting each interval.\n*   **Multi-class Hinge Loss:** Emphasizing the large margin classifier aspect of training.\n*   **\u2113[2]-norm constraints:** Enforcing adversarial robustness by ensuring constraints on the \u2113[2]-norm."

Key Findings and Contributions Related to Adversarial Robustness**\n\n*   **Smoothness as a Key Factor:** The paper emphasizes the connection between the smoothness of a neural network and its adversarial robustness. The intuition is that networks with smaller local Lipschitz constants are less sensitive to adversarial perturbations.\n*   **Overparameterization and Smoothness:** The core argument is that overparameterized Convolutional Residual Networks (ConvResNets) can achieve both good function approximation and sufficient first-order smoothness. Larger networks are more likely to be smooth and, therefore, more robust.\n*   **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper provides theoretical guarantees on the approximation ability of ConvResNets in terms of Sobolev norms. It shows that as the number of residual blocks or channels per filter increases, the approximation of the target function improves.\n*   **Lipschitz Continuity:** The paper derives a Lipschitz continuity bound for ConvResNets, demonstrating that larger networks tend to have better (smaller) Lipschitz constants.\n*   **Adversarial Risk Analysis:** The paper formalizes the concept of adversarial risk and presents a theorem (Theorem 4) that links the adversarial risk of a network to its Lipschitz constant, the Lipschitz constant of the loss function, and the adversarial perturbation parameter (\u03b4). It suggests that larger, smoother networks can achieve smaller adversarial risk, implying improved adversarial robustness.\n*   **Empirical Validation:** Numerical experiments are conducted using the CIFAR-10 dataset to verify the theoretical findings. The experiments use the TRADES model, which encourages model smoothness. They show that wider and deeper WideResNet architectures achieve better robustness (higher robust accuracy) while maintaining similar natural accuracy.\n\n**II.

This indicates that PGD attacks are a standard benchmark for assessing adversarial robustness.\n*   **Trade-off between Robustness and Accuracy:** The paper acknowledges the trade-off between robustness and accuracy, a common challenge in adversarial robustness research. The experiments attempt to control for this trade-off by tuning hyperparameters to achieve similar natural accuracy across different network architectures.\n\n**III.

      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided research paper and extracted the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the paper's content related to the question, focusing on trends, methods, and relevant details:\n\n**I. General Trends in Adversarial Robustness (as presented in the paper):**\n\n*   **Focus on Few-Shot Learning:** The paper addresses the trend of applying adversarial robustness techniques to the *few-shot learning* paradigm.  This is a key area where robustness is crucial but challenging due to limited data. The work highlights the practical importance of building robust few-shot classifiers, especially in safety-critical systems where reliability against adversarial examples is essential.\n*   **Shift from Meta-Learning to Simpler Approaches:** The paper identifies a trend away from computationally intensive meta-learning approaches for adversarial robustness in few-shot learning and towards simpler, more scalable methods based on transfer learning. It argues that standard mini-batch based adversarial training on base categories, combined with techniques like calibrated centroid-based classification for novel categories, can be surprisingly effective.\n*   **Importance of Base Model Robustness:**  The paper emphasizes the significance of a robust base model trained on a large dataset as a foundation for achieving adversarial robustness in few-shot classification. Fine-tuning from a robust base model is presented as a resource-efficient way to improve robustness.\n*   **Use of Calibrated Classifiers:** Calibrated Nearest Centroid (CNC) classifiers are presented as a way to improve robustness in novel categories by calibrating the centroid of the few-shot category towards the base classes.\n\n**II. Specific Methods and Techniques Mentioned (with a focus on recent developments):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training (AT):** This remains a cornerstone technique.  The paper uses Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) as the adversary in the adversarial training process.  The key idea is to train the model on adversarial examples generated by PGD.\n    *   The paper utilizes PGD with specific parameters: 7 iterations during training with \u03f5 = 8/255 and \u03b1 = 2/255. During evaluation, the paper leverages 20 iterations of PGD to create an adversarial example and measure accuracy w.r.t ground truth.\n*   **Weight Averaging (WA):** Weight averaging is employed as a method to improve generalization and find flatter optima in the loss surface.  It involves maintaining a separate copy of the weights and performing exponential moving average.\n    *   The paper sets \u03c4 = 0.999 for weight averaging during training.\n*   **Calibrated Nearest Centroid (CNC) Classifier:** This is a key contribution of the paper. It calibrates the mean of each novel category using the statistic of base data and classifies query samples using a non-parametric Nearest Centroid-based algorithm.\n    *   The calibration utilizes m = 2 number of base categories.\n    *   Prior to inference, the embeddings are transformed by taking the square root of each dimension.\n*   **Distribution Calibration (DC):** Distribution Calibration is used to calibrate the feature distributions of the novel categories using the base dataset.\n*   **TRADES:** TRADES is used as an alternative to PGD adversarial training during the base training stage.\n*   **Contrastive Learning (CL):** A contrastive learning objective is used to leverage unlabelled data and improve both standard and robust accuracy.\n*   **Interval Bound Propagation (IBP):** Is used as an alternative to PGD adversarial training during the robust base training to provide verifiable robustness.\n    *   The paper leverages \u03f5 = 8/255 for 1000 epochs.\n\n**III. Comparison with Other Recent Works (important for understanding the current state-of-the-art):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Querying (AQ) [17]:** This method creates adversarial examples for query data and optimizes a meta-learner to be robust to adversarial examples.\n*   **OFA [53]:** This method combines MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) with adversarial training to improve robustness. OFA also explores contrastive learning.\n\n**IV. Datasets Used (reflecting common benchmarks):**\n\n*   Mini-ImageNet\n*   CIFAR-FS\n*   CUB (showing a trend toward fine-grained datasets)\n*   TieredImageNet\n\n**V. Key Findings and Claims Related to Trends:**\n\n*   A simple transfer-learning-based approach can train adversarially robust few-shot classifiers effectively.\n*   Standard adversarial training on base categories, along with a calibrated centroid-based classifier in novel categories, outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art advanced methods.\n*   Weight averaging and calibrated nearest centroid classifier can improve robustness.\n*   The simplicity of the approach makes it easier to incorporate new approaches to robustness.\n*   It is possible to train verifiably robust models for few-shot settings.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe paper indicates a trend toward simpler, more scalable, and transfer-learning-based approaches to adversarial robustness in few-shot learning, moving away from complex meta-learning methods.  Key techniques include adversarial training with PGD, weight averaging, and calibrated nearest centroid classifiers.

      "summary": "Okay, let's extract the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the findings:\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper focuses on improving the performance of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) on image classification tasks using knowledge distillation. A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to analyzing the adversarial robustness of these improved Neural ODEs.\n\n**Key Findings Related to Adversarial Robustness (and relevant to the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Knowledge Distillation Enhances Robustness:** The paper demonstrates that training Neural ODEs using knowledge distillation significantly improves their robustness against adversarial examples generated by white-box attacks like PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) and MI-FGSM (Momentum Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method).\n\n    *   The experiments show that the original Neural ODEs are more susceptible to adversarial attacks, but Neural ODEs trained with knowledge distillation maintain their accuracy better as the perturbation size (epsilon) increases. (See Figure 1)\n*   **Time Horizon Matters Significantly:** A key finding is that increasing the \"time horizon\" in Neural ODEs drastically improves their adversarial robustness.\n\n    *   The authors argue that this robustness is *not* primarily due to \"obfuscated gradients\" (as suggested by some previous work [11]), but rather a direct consequence of the longer time horizon.\n    *   Neural ODEs with a larger time horizon (e.g., NODEs(100)) trained with knowledge distillation show much better resistance to adversarial examples than those with a shorter time horizon (e.g., NODEs(1)).\n    *   Experiments with a very large time horizon (Neural ODEs(500)) further confirm this trend, demonstrating high robustness even against strong adversarial perturbations (Table 3).\n*   **Trade-off:** The paper acknowledges a trade-off: Increasing the time horizon improves robustness but slows down training and might slightly reduce the effect of knowledge distillation.\n*   **Datasets and Attacks:** The robustness evaluations were performed on CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets using PGD and MI-FGSM attacks. The paper details the specific configurations used for these attacks (e.g., perturbation size, step size, momentum).\n*   **Comparison to ResNet:** The paper compares the robustness of Neural ODEs (with and without knowledge distillation) to ResNet models. The results indicate that while original Neural ODEs might be less robust than ResNets, Neural ODEs trained with knowledge distillation and a larger time horizon can achieve comparable or even superior robustness.\n*   **Relevant Citations:** Several citations within the paper are relevant to adversarial robustness in the last 2 years:\n    *   **[3] Derek Onken, Samy Wu Fung, Xingjian Li, and Lars Ruthotto, \u201cOt-flow: Fast and accurate continuous normalizing flows via optimal transport,\u201d _arXiv preprint_ _arXiv:2006.00104, 2020._**\n    *   **[5] Patrick Kidger, James Morrill, James Foster, and Terry Lyons, \u201cNeural controlled differential equations for irregular time series,\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.08926, 2020.**\n    *   **[7] Ricky TQ Chen, Brandon Amos, and Maximilian Nickel, \u201cLearning neural event functions for ordinary differential equations,\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.03902, 2020.**\n    *   **[8] Kunal Gupta and Manmohan Chandraker, \u201cNeural mesh flow: 3d manifold mesh generationvia diffeomorphic flows,\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.10973, 2020.**\n    *   **[9] Eric Z Chen, Terrence Chen, and Shanhui Sun, \u201cMri image reconstruction via learning optimization using neural odes,\u201d in International Conference on Medical_Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention._Springer, 2020, pp. 83\u201393.**\n    *   **[10] Giorgio Giannone, Asha Anoosheh, Alessio Quaglino, Pierluca D\u2019Oro, Marco Gallieri, and Jonathan Masci, \u201cReal-time classification from short event-camera streamsusing input-filtering neural odes,\u201d _arXiv preprint_ _arXiv:2004.03156, 2020._**\n    *   **[11] Yifei Huang, Yaodong Yu, Hongyang Zhang, Yi Ma, and Yuan Yao, \u201cAdversarial robustness of stabilizedneuralodes might be from obfuscated gradients,\u201d arXiv_preprint arXiv:2009.13145, 2020.**\n    *   **[25] Seyed Iman Mirzadeh, Mehrdad Farajtabar, Ang Li, NirLevine, Akihiro Matsukawa, and Hassan Ghasemzadeh,\u201cImproved knowledge distillation via teacher assistant,\u201din Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial In_telligence, 2020, vol. 34, pp. 5191\u20135198._**\n\n**In summary, the paper suggests these trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (within the context of Neural ODEs):**\n\n1.  **Knowledge distillation is a valuable technique to improve the adversarial robustness of Neural ODEs.**\n2.  **The time horizon is a critical factor in the robustness of Neural ODEs, with longer time horizons leading to significantly better resistance to adversarial attacks.**  This is an important point because it challenges the \"obfuscated gradients\" explanation for Neural ODE robustness."

      "summary": "Here's a detailed extraction of the information from the provided paper that addresses the research question:\n\n**Research Question:** What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**Overview of the Paper and Why It's (Likely) Not Directly Relevant**\n\nThe provided paper, \"Text-CRS: A Generalized Certified Robustness Framework against Textual Adversarial Attacks,\" focuses on *text* classification, *not* image classification.  Therefore, while it deals with adversarial robustness, it is likely to have limited direct relevance to the specific trends in *image* classification.  However, some *general* concepts or techniques *might* be adapted or show parallels.  Let's analyze, but with the understanding it's primarily about text.  Also, note that the paper appears to have been written in 2023, so the content would be within the last 2 years relative to 2024.\n\n**Key Aspects of Adversarial Robustness Addressed (in Text Domain):**\n\n*   **Certified Robustness vs. Empirical Robustness:** The paper strongly emphasizes the shift *towards* *provable robustness guarantees* (certified robustness) rather than relying solely on *empirical defenses*. Empirical defenses (e.g., adversarial training, feature detection, input transformation) are often effective against *specific* attacks but can be bypassed by *adaptive* attacks. Certified robustness aims to provide guarantees that a model's predictions will remain stable within a defined range of adversarial perturbations.  This is a key trend *in general* for robustness.\n*   **Randomized Smoothing:** The paper highlights Randomized Smoothing as a prominent certified defense method. It's a technique that injects random noise into the input data during training to smooth the classifier. This makes the classifier more likely to make consistent predictions even when the input is perturbed.\n*   **Addressing the Discrete Nature of Text:**  A key challenge in NLP (and a point where it differs significantly from image classification) is that text data is discrete. Numerical norms like l1 or l2 cannot be directly applied to measure the distance between texts without considering word embeddings. This means that techniques developed for images might not directly translate.\n*   **Word-Level Adversarial Operations:** The paper focuses specifically on *word-level* attacks in text, which involve manipulating individual words to alter the output. The four fundamental operations they consider are:\n    *   Synonym Substitution\n    *   Word Reordering\n    *   Word Insertion\n    *   Word Deletion\n*   **Permutation and Embedding Transformations:** The paper models word-level attacks as combinations of permutations and embedding transformations. For example, synonym substitution is viewed as transforming word embeddings, while reordering is a permutation. This is a crucial conceptual contribution of the work.\n*   **Customized Noise Distributions:** The paper argues that using appropriate noise distributions for the randomized smoothing process is crucial.  They propose Staircase, Uniform, Gaussian, and Bernoulli smoothing distributions for different word-level operations, rather than simply using a uniform distribution for synonym substitution.\n*   **Training Techniques:** The paper describes a \"training toolkit\" to improve certified accuracy, especially against word insertions:\n    *   Optimized Gaussian Noise (OGN): Using an anisotropic Gaussian noise (i.e. different standard deviations for different dimensions) and optimizing the mean.\n    *   Embedding Space Reconstruction (ESR): An encoder-decoder architecture to reconstruct the \"clean\" embedding space. This acts as a denoiser.\n    *   Pre-trained Large Model (PLM): Fine-tuning on a pre-trained large language model.\n*   **Universality:** The paper explores the idea of a single defense being applicable to multiple types of attacks.  They find that the word insertion technique can, in fact, be applied as a generalized defense, although specific defenses tailored to individual operations perform better when the attack is known.\n*   **ChatGPT Evaluation:** A very current aspect is the use of ChatGPT to evaluate the semantic similarity between clean and adversarial texts.  This provides a practical measure of how deceptive the attacks are.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Results**\n\n*   **Staircase Randomization:**  This is a novel smoothing method they use for synonym substitution (Definition 2), aiming to make more semantically similar synonyms more likely to be substituted.\n*   **Theorem 1:** States the certified radius for synonym substitution under the Staircase distribution (`RADS`).\n*   **Theorem 2:** Provides the certified radius for word reordering based on a uniform distribution (`RADR`).\n*   **Theorem 3:** Provides the certified radius for word insertion based on Gaussian noise (`RADI`).\n*   **Theorem 4:** Formalizes that if a classifier is robust to both permutation and embedding perturbations individually, it's robust to their combination.\n*   **Theorem 5:** Provides the certified radius for word deletion based on a Bernoulli distribution (`RADD`).\n\n**Experiment Details and Benchmarking:**\n\n*   The paper compares Text-CRS with SAFER and CISS, which are SOTA randomized smoothing-based certified defenses. They evaluate on AG\u2019s News, Amazon, and IMDB datasets using LSTM and BERT models.\n*   Text-CRS outperforms SAFER and CISS in terms of certified accuracy against synonym substitution and, importantly, provides the first benchmarks for certified robustness against word reordering, insertion, and deletion.\n\n**Possible Image Classification Parallels (Though Limited):**\n\n*   **Certified Robustness:**  The overall *goal* of achieving certified robustness remains a key trend in image classification.  Researchers are trying to move beyond empirical defenses.\n*   **Randomized Smoothing:** The use of randomized smoothing is a technique applicable to both text and images. The basic principle of injecting noise to smooth the classifier is common. However, the noise distributions and transformations will differ based on the data type.\n*   **Semantic Transformations:** The mention of providing robustness guarantees against semantic transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, shearing) in images is the most direct connection.\n*   **Anisotropic Noise:** The use of anisotropic Gaussian noise (OGN) can also be found in image classifications.\n*   **Ensembling and Fine-Tuning Large Models:** Using the ESR and PLM techniques also have parallels in the image domain.\n\n**Why This Paper Might *Not* Be Useful for Answering the Question:**\n\n1.  **Domain Mismatch:** The fundamental difference between image and text data means that many of the techniques in this paper will be irrelevant to image classification.\n2.  **Specific Attacks:** Word-level attacks (synonym substitution, reordering, etc.) have no direct equivalents in image classification.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe \"Text-CRS\" paper is a solid contribution to the field of *textual* adversarial robustness, focusing on certified defenses against word-level attacks. It's likely to be of *limited* use in understanding trends in *image* classification because the data modalities are so different.\n\nIf you want a summary about the *image classification*, you will need a different document!"

      "relevancy": "This paper discusses certified robustness for sequence classifiers using randomized deletion. While the focus is on sequence classification and edit distance, the techniques used are part of the broader trend of certified robustness.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided paper, focusing on information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Core Argument of the Paper (Relevance to Broader Robustness Trends)**\n\nWhile this paper does *not* directly address image classification, it is highly relevant to the *broader trend* of extending adversarial robustness techniques beyond the standard image domain. The authors argue that most prior work in certified robustness has focused on *continuous, fixed-dimensional inputs* (like images with pixel values), and that the associated threat models (like \u2113p-norm bounded perturbations) are *not well-suited* for other data types.  They explicitly call out the limitations of \u2113p robustness and discuss scenarios where \u2113p norms fail (such as slightly misaligned sequences).\n\n**The paper highlights the need to consider robustness in settings with:**\n\n*   **Discrete or variable-size inputs:**  Examples include source code, binary executables, and PDF files. The paper directly mentions point cloud classification.\n*   **Different threat models:**  Specifically, edit distance-bounded adversaries, who can perform insertions, deletions, and substitutions.  This contrasts with the \u2113p-norm focus of image classification.\n*  **Sequence Classifiers:** Classifiers that process sequential data.\n\n**Key Contributions of the Paper (and their relevance to the broader field of Robustness):**\n\n1.  **RS-Del: Randomized Deletion Smoothing:**\n    *   The authors propose a novel smoothing mechanism called RS-Del specifically designed for *sequence classifiers* and *edit distance robustness*.\n    *   RS-Del uses *random deletions* to smooth the classifier's predictions.  This is a significant departure from the typical noise-addition techniques used in image classification.\n    *   A crucial (and perhaps surprising) finding is that using *only deletions* is sufficient to provide robustness against deletion, insertion, *and* substitution edits. This is a point of innovation and contributes to the efficiency of their approach.\n\n2.  **Edit Distance Robustness Certificates:**\n    *   The paper provides a theoretical framework for *certifying* the robustness of sequence classifiers against edit distance-bounded adversaries.\n    *   Their proof method deviates from the standard Neyman-Pearson approach used in image classification, as they deem it intractable for their setting.  Instead, they base their proof around *longest common subsequences (LCS)*.\n\n3.  **Tunable Decision Thresholds:**\n    *   The introduction of tunable decision thresholds is another noteworthy aspect.  This allows for a trade-off between misclassification rates and certification radii between classes. The malware example shows that it can be important to have a high accuracy in classifying malware (minimizing false negatives) and less important to be accurate in classifying benign files (reduce false positives)\n    *   This is especially useful in scenarios where misclassification costs are asymmetric (e.g., in malware detection, it's much worse to classify a malicious file as benign).\n\n4.  **Application to Malware Detection:**\n    *   They demonstrate the practical application of RS-Del to malware detection, a binary classification problem on byte sequences.\n    *   They achieve a certified accuracy of 91% at an edit distance radius of 128 bytes on a popular malware detection model (MalConv).\n    *   They also explore asymmetric certificates, favoring the malicious class, and certificates covering edits at the machine instruction level.\n\n**Relevance to Recent Trends (even though it's not image classification):**\n\nThis paper is relevant to several recent trends in adversarial robustness:\n\n*   **Moving Beyond \u2113p-Norms:** A growing recognition that \u2113p-norm bounded perturbations are not always the most relevant or realistic threat model, especially in domains beyond images. The paper provides a concrete alternative for sequence data.\n*   **Certified Robustness for Non-Image Data:**  The development of methods for *certifying* robustness for data types beyond images is an active area of research. This paper contributes to that trend by providing a certificate for sequence data under edit distance.\n*   **Randomized Smoothing Variations:** While randomized smoothing has been popular in image classification, this paper shows how the core idea can be adapted and extended to different data types and threat models, requiring novel smoothing mechanisms.\n*   **Practical Applications:** The focus on malware detection demonstrates the potential real-world impact of certified robustness techniques. It is critical to guarantee a malware classifier's robustness in the field due to the severe consequences it can have if compromised\n\n**Limitations of the Paper (for answering the image classification question):**\n\n*   The paper does *not* directly address image classification or any specific adversarial attacks in that domain.\n*   The proposed techniques (RS-Del and the LCS-based certification method) are specifically tailored for sequence data and may not be directly applicable to images.\n\n**In summary:**  This paper is not directly about image classification. However, it is valuable because it pushes the boundaries of adversarial robustness beyond the traditional image domain.  It demonstrates the need for new threat models and certification techniques for other data types, and provides a concrete example of how this can be done for sequence data.  The techniques described here could *potentially* inspire new approaches to robustness in image classification by highlighting the limitations of existing methods."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information to address the research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**Note:** *This paper focuses on point cloud classification, NOT image classification. Therefore, while the techniques might be adaptable, the information is only tangentially relevant to image classification.*\n\n**I. Focus of the Paper (and Relevance to Adversarial Robustness Trends):**\n\n*   The paper addresses **adversarial robustness in point cloud classification**, a field related to but distinct from image classification.\n*   It introduces \"PointCert,\" a novel certified defense mechanism that aims to provide *deterministic* robustness guarantees against adversarial perturbations in point clouds.\n\n**II. Key Concepts and Techniques (that *could* be trends if adapted to image classification*):\n\n*   **Certified Defense:**  The paper emphasizes moving beyond *empirical* defenses (which are often broken) to *certified* defenses.  This is a major trend. Certified defenses provide provable guarantees of robustness within a defined threat model.\n*   **Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Guarantees:**  The core innovation is providing *deterministic* robustness.  Existing certified defenses (like randomized smoothing, PointGuard) provide *probabilistic* guarantees. Deterministic guarantees are highly desirable, especially for safety-critical applications.\n*   **Ensemble Methods:** PointCert uses an ensemble approach. It transforms a base classifier into a more robust one. This is a common trend in adversarial robustness.\n*   **Sub-Point Cloud Division:** PointCert divides a point cloud into disjoint sub-point clouds.  This is a crucial step for achieving deterministic guarantees. The rationale is to limit the impact of adversarial modifications.\n*   **Majority Voting:**  The ensemble prediction is made by majority voting among the predictions of the sub-point clouds.\n*   **Optimization for Certified Robustness:**  The paper explores different training strategies (Scenarios I, II, III) to optimize the performance of PointCert. This emphasizes the importance of *training with robustness in mind*, not as an afterthought.\n*   **Point Completion Networks (PCNs):**  The paper integrates PCNs to \"complete\" sub-point clouds before classification. This demonstrates the use of auxiliary networks to improve robustness.\n*   **Loss Function Design:**  A new loss function is proposed to train the PCN specifically to improve classification accuracy on the completed point clouds. This shows the trend of tailoring loss functions for robustness.\n*   **Knowledge Distillation:**  The paper uses knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a \"teacher\" model to a \"student\" model) to address the black-box setting (where the attacker only has access to the prediction API).\n\n**III. State-of-the-Art Comparisons:**\n\n*   The paper compares PointCert to:\n    *   **Undefended Model:**  A baseline to demonstrate the vulnerability of standard models.\n    *   **Randomized Smoothing:**  A popular certified defense technique.\n    *   **PointGuard:** Another certified defense specifically designed for point clouds.\n\n**IV. Experimental Results (and potential trends suggested by them):**\n\n*   **Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off:**  The paper acknowledges and addresses the inherent trade-off between accuracy and robustness.\n*   **Superior Performance of PointCert:** The experiments demonstrate that PointCert outperforms state-of-the-art certified defenses (randomized smoothing, PointGuard) in terms of both empirical and certified accuracy.\n*   **Importance of Training Strategy:** Scenario II (training the base classifier on sub-point clouds) significantly improves performance.\n*   **Effectiveness of PCNs:** Scenario III (using a PCN to \"complete\" sub-point clouds) improves performance over Scenario I.\n*   **Impact of Hash Function:** The choice of hash function (MD5 vs. a mean-based hash) impacts performance, suggesting the importance of deterministic partitioning strategies.\n*   **Knowledge Distillation for Black-Box Settings:** Knowledge distillation allows PointCert to achieve similar certified accuracy in black-box settings compared to white-box.\n*   **Pre-training:**  Fine-tuning a pre-trained PCN improves performance when only a small amount of labeled data is available.\n\n**V.

      "summary": "Here's a breakdown of the information from the paper relevant to your research question, focusing on papers from the last 2 years (approximately, given the NeurIPS 2023 publication date).\n\n**Key Idea: Hierarchical Randomized Smoothing**\n\n*   **Core Concept:** The paper introduces \"hierarchical randomized smoothing\" as a novel framework for improving adversarial robustness in image classification (and other tasks like node classification). The main idea is to apply randomized smoothing *selectively* to subsets of data entities (e.g., pixels in an image, nodes in a graph) rather than to the entire input.\n*   **Motivation:**\n    *   Traditional randomized smoothing adds noise to the entire input, which can hurt accuracy.\n    *   Adversaries often only perturb a *subset* of entities in complex data.\n    *   Hierarchical smoothing aims to provide stronger robustness guarantees while maintaining high accuracy, particularly when adversaries have limited perturbation capabilities.\n*   **How it Works:**\n    1.  **Entity Selection:** Randomly select a subset of entities (rows in a data matrix) to smooth. This selection is governed by a \"upper-level smoothing distribution\" (Bernoulli distribution in the paper's examples).\n    2.  **Noise Addition:** Apply a \"lower-level smoothing distribution\" (e.g., Gaussian noise for continuous data, sparse noise for discrete data, or ablation) to the selected entities only.\n    3.  **Certification:**  The method certifies robustness by showing that the majority vote prediction of a classifier remains stable even when the input is perturbed in this hierarchical manner.\n*   **Benefits:**\n    *   **Stronger Robustness-Accuracy Trade-off:**  Hierarchical smoothing expands the Pareto front, offering a better balance between robustness (provable resistance to adversarial attacks) and clean accuracy (performance on unperturbed data).\n    *   **Flexibility:**  It can integrate various existing smoothing distributions as the \"lower-level\" component, meaning new robustness certificates don't need to be derived from scratch for different noise types.\n    *   **Generality:** Applies to both continuous (e.g., images) and discrete (e.g., graphs) data.\n    *   **Efficiency:**  The additional computational cost for certification is minimal.\n*   **Key Contributions (from the paper's introduction):**\n    *   A novel framework for strong robustness certificates on complex data with decomposable objects.\n    *   Instantiations with well-established smoothing distributions, leading to novel robustness certificates for discrete and continuous domains.\n    *   Demonstrated importance in image and node classification, showing significant expansion of the robustness-accuracy Pareto front.\n\n**Relevance to Image Classification (and Adversarial Robustness Trends):**\n\n*   **Pixel-Level Attacks:** The paper directly addresses the scenario where adversaries can only manipulate a limited number of pixels in an image, a common threat model in image classification.\n*   **Gaussian Smoothing:**  The paper leverages Gaussian randomized smoothing, a widely used technique, as its \"lower-level\" distribution for image data.\n*   **Pareto-Front Improvement:** The experimental results on CIFAR10 with ResNet50 models clearly show that hierarchical smoothing achieves better certified accuracy for a given clean accuracy compared to standard Gaussian smoothing or ablation-based methods.\n*   **Generalization of Existing Methods:** The paper demonstrates that hierarchical smoothing generalizes both additive noise (Gaussian) and ablation certificates. It is \"orthogonal to all existing robustness certificates that are based on randomized smoothing.\"\n*   **Flexibility in Noising Strategy:** The entity-selection probability *p* allows fine-grained control over the level of smoothing applied to the input image, which is important given the robustness-accuracy trade-off.\n*   **Current focus:** This paper was written in 2023, so it represents a very current contribution to the field.\n\n**Specific Details & Instantiations:**\n\n*   **Continuous Data (Images):**\n    *   Uses Gaussian isotropic smoothing as the lower-level distribution.\n    *   Considers an \u21132-norm threat model, bounding the perturbation strength of the manipulated pixels.\n    *   Provides a corollary outlining the specific robustness certificate for this case (Corollary 1).\n*   **Experimental Setup (CIFAR10):**\n    *   Uses ResNet50 as the image classification model.\n    *   Trains models on smoothed data.\n    *   Compares against standard Gaussian smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019) and ablation-based smoothing (Levine and Feizi, 2020b).\n    *   Exhaustively searches the space of smoothing parameters to demonstrate the Pareto-optimality of hierarchical smoothing.\n    *   Includes details on training, augmentation, normalization, and hyperparameter settings to ensure reproducibility.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions:**\n\n*   **Inherited Limitations:**  The method inherits some limitations from ablation certificates, where the certifiable radius can be bounded by smoothing parameters independently of the classifier.\n*   **Non-ideal certificates:** Invariances may not be fully incorporated, leading to looser guarantees.\n*   **Future Research:**  The paper identifies several areas for future work:\n    *   Developing tighter certificates specific to the hierarchical smoothing framework.\n    *   Implementing certificates for other \u2113p-norms and domains.\n    *   Improving and assessing adversarial robustness through novel architectures and training techniques.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the field of adversarial robustness for image classification. Hierarchical randomized smoothing is a promising technique for improving the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. It builds upon and generalizes existing randomized smoothing methods, offering a flexible and efficient approach to certifying the robustness of image classifiers against pixel-level attacks. The detailed experimental results and analysis provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

The paper is recent and directly addresses adversarial robustness for image classification models.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this research paper and extract the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** MIMIR: Masked Image Modeling for Mutual Information-based Adversarial Robustness\n\n**Key Areas and Relevant Details:**\n\n1.  **Introduction and Related Work (Section 1 & 2):**\n    *   **Adversarial Training (AT) for ViTs:** The paper notes that early works focused on the unique attention mechanism of ViTs for adversarial robustness.  Recent works predominantly adapt adversarial training techniques from CNNs to ViTs, building upon the success of AT in making CNNs robust.\n    *   **Data Augmentation:**  Strong data augmentation techniques (Randaugment, CutMix, MixUp), which are beneficial for CNN AT, are often *ineffective* or even *detrimental* to ViT AT.  To address this, distortion magnitudes of augmentations like Randaugment and the probability of applying MixUp/CutMix need to be adjusted progressively. Another approach involves using basic data augmentations (random-resize-and-crop, horizontal-flipping, color-jitter) combined with high weight decay.\n    *   **Pre-trained Models:** Leveraging pre-trained models is common in ViT adversarial training. Fine-tuning on naturally pre-trained models can enhance robustness.  AdvXL (Wang et al. 2024) is cited as an example of an efficient adversarial training strategy for large models on web-scale datasets. However, the authors also mention that pre-training with ImageNet-21K and SimMIM (Xie et al. 2022) sometimes shows similar results as training from scratch, and CLIP (Radford et al. 2021) might even lead to a performance drop.\n    *   **Mutual Information (MI):** The authors highlight that they provide an in-depth analysis of ViT robustness using MI, focusing on self-supervised pre-training. They propose that self-supervised ViTs benefit from *decreasing* the MI between inputs and latent features. This motivates their proposed method, MIMIR.\n    *   **PGD adversarial training:** PGD is one of the most effective defenses, and it also requires new training methods.\n    *   **(Mo et al. 2022; Bai et al. 2021; Debenedetti, Sehwag, and Mittal 2023) demonstrate the classical training recipe for CNN is not suitable for ViTs and present new adversarial training strategies for ViTs by evaluating different hyperparameters and data augmentation policies.**\n    *   **(Mo et al. 2022) also finds that pre-training with natural data provides better robustness after adversarial fine-tuning.**\n    *   **(Singh, Croce, and Hein 2023) explores the effect of strong pre-training and replacing the patch embedding in ViTs with convolutional blocks.**\n    *   **AdvXL (Wang et al. 2024) shows an outstanding performance of giant models and web-scale data with adversarial pretraining and fine-tuning.**\n\n2.  **MIMIR (Section 3):**\n    *   **Core Idea:**  MIMIR leverages Masked Image Modeling (MIM) but introduces adversarial perturbations to the input images during pre-training.  The goal is for the model to reconstruct the *original* (natural) images from these perturbed inputs.\n    *   **Mutual Information Penalty:** A key aspect is using Mutual Information (MI) as a penalty in the pre-training loss. The rationale is to *reduce* the MI between the adversarial examples and the learned latent representation.\n    *   **Theoretical Justification:**  The paper provides theoretical justification, arguing that constraining the MI between the adversarial example and its latent representation (I(x + \u03b4, z)) is beneficial.  They present Lemma 3.1 and Propositions 3.2 and 3.3 to support this claim.\n    *   **Autoencoder Architecture:** MIMIR employs an autoencoder structure (encoder and decoder) similar to MAE (Masked Autoencoders). The encoder extracts features from masked, perturbed patches, and the decoder reconstructs the original image.\n\n3.  **Experiments (Section 4):**\n    *   **Datasets:** Evaluated on ImageNet-1K, Tiny-ImageNet, and CIFAR-10.\n    *   **Comparison with SOTA (State-of-the-Art):** Table 1 demonstrates that MIMIR outperforms existing adversarial training methods on ImageNet-1K.\n    *   **Ablation Study:**  Table 3 shows the impact of different pre-training and fine-tuning methods, highlighting the contribution of MIMIR.\n    *   **Adaptive Attacks:**  MIMIR is evaluated against specifically designed adaptive attacks (PGD-MI, PGD-fea) and shows robustness.\n\n4.  **Mentioned Papers (Crucial for the \"Last 2 Years\" Requirement):**\n\n    *   **Wang et al.

(2024):** \"A comprehensive study on robustness of image classification models: Benchmarking and rethinking.\" This paper provides analysis that pre-training with ImageNet-21K and SimMIM performs similarly to the model trained from scratch, and the CLIP pre-trained model has a performance drop.\n    *   **Singh, Croce, and Hein (2023):** \"Revisiting Adversarial Training for ImageNet: Architectures, Training and Generalization across Threat Models.\" Explores the effect of strong pre-training and replacing the patch embedding in ViTs with convolutional blocks.\n    *   **Debenedetti, Sehwag, and Mittal (2023):** \"A Light Recipe to Train Robust Vision Transformers.\"\n    *   **Peng et al.

(2022):** \"SimMIM: A Simple Framework for Masked Image Modeling.\" In CVPR.\n\n**Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Based on the Paper and the Time Constraint):**\n\n*   **Adaptation of CNN Techniques to ViTs:**  A major trend involves adapting successful adversarial training techniques from CNNs to ViTs. However, direct transfer is often ineffective.  Careful tuning and modification of techniques are necessary.\n*   **Importance of Data Augmentation:**  Data augmentation remains crucial, but the *type* and *intensity* of augmentation must be carefully chosen for ViTs. Strong augmentations that work well for CNNs can hurt ViT robustness.\n*   **Pre-training Strategies:**  Pre-training continues to be a vital area. However, the optimal pre-training strategy for *adversarial robustness* in ViTs is still an active research area.  Naive pre-training or even some sophisticated pre-training methods (like CLIP) can sometimes *decrease* robustness.\n*   **Mutual Information Analysis:**  The paper itself contributes to a trend of using information-theoretic concepts like Mutual Information to analyze and improve adversarial robustness. This is a more theoretical approach to understanding the properties of robust models.  MIMIR is a concrete example of how MI can be used to design a new defense.\n*   **Adaptive Attacks:**  Evaluation against adaptive attacks (where the attacker is aware of the defense mechanism) is becoming increasingly important for assessing the *true* robustness of models.\n*   **Large Models and Web-Scale Data:** AdvXL (Wang et al., 2024) indicates a trend toward leveraging large models and web-scale datasets for adversarial training, although this can be computationally expensive.\n*   **Convolutional Stems for ViTs:** Replacing the patch embedding layer in ViTs with a convolutional stem (ConvStem) can improve robustness (mentioned in Singh et al., 2023).\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe latest trends focus on adapting existing adversarial training techniques, particularly those from CNNs, to work effectively with ViTs. Specific areas of interest include careful selection and tuning of data augmentation strategies, exploring optimal pre-training methods that enhance robustness (with information-theoretic analysis playing a role), and thorough evaluation using adaptive attacks.  The use of large models and convolutional stems is also being explored."

      "relevancy": "This paper introduces a new framework called 'General Lipschitz (GL)' for certified robustness against semantic transformations in image classifiers. It is within the 2-year window and focuses on a method to improve robustness.",
      "summary": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided paper and extracted the information most relevant to your research question about recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on papers from the last two years.  I've been very detailed in my extraction.\n\n**Overview of the Paper**\n\nThe paper \"General Lipschitz: Certified Robustness Against Resolvable Semantic Transformations via Transformation-Dependent Randomized Smoothing\" introduces a novel framework, \"General Lipschitz\" (GL), for certifying neural networks against *resolvable semantic transformations*.  This means transformations like blurring, translation, gamma correction, and compositions thereof, where the effect of applying one transformation followed by another can be represented by a single equivalent transformation. The authors achieve this by analyzing the transformation-dependent Lipschitz continuity of *smoothed classifiers*.  Smoothed classifiers are created by averaging the output of a base classifier over noisy or transformed versions of the input. The key idea is to provide provable guarantees on model behavior under different input transformations.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question: Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Last 2 Years)**\n\nThe paper is directly relevant, as it falls within the scope of adversarial robustness for image classification and was published in 2023 (arXiv:2309.16710), satisfying the time constraint. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information and trends it highlights:\n\n1.  **Randomized Smoothing as a Dominant Paradigm:**\n\n    *   The paper explicitly states that *randomized smoothing* is the \"state-of-the-art approach\" for constructing provably robust image classifiers against additive adversarial perturbations. This confirms that randomized smoothing continues to be a central technique.  The authors build upon this foundation.\n\n2.  **Shift from Additive Perturbations to Semantic Transformations:**\n\n    *   A key trend is the move beyond simple additive perturbations (like adding small amounts of noise to each pixel) to more complex *semantic transformations*.  The paper directly addresses the challenge of certifying robustness against these transformations (e.g., blurring, translation, contrast changes, gamma correction).  This is a critical development because real-world attacks are more likely to involve semantic manipulations.\n\n3.  **Certified Robustness as a Key Goal:**\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes *certified robustness*, which provides provable guarantees about a model's behavior under attack.  This is a more rigorous approach than *empirical robustness*, where models are simply trained to be resistant to specific attacks.  Certified robustness is crucial for applications where safety and reliability are paramount.  The GL framework is a contribution to this area.\n\n4.  **Transformation-Specific Smoothing:**\n\n    *   The paper highlights the trend of *transformation-specific randomized smoothing*, where the smoothing process is tailored to the type of transformation being considered. This involves analyzing the Lipschitz continuity of the smoothed classifier with respect to the *parameters* of the transformation. This allows for tighter robustness certificates than generic smoothing methods. The paper cites \\[28] and \\[16] as key works in this area. This paper expands on prior work to handle compositions of resolvable transformations.\n\n5.  **Lipschitz Continuity Analysis:**\n\n    *   Analyzing the Lipschitz continuity of neural networks is a recurring theme in certified robustness. The paper builds upon this idea by focusing on the *transformation-dependent* Lipschitz continuity of smoothed classifiers.  The \"General Lipschitz\" framework aims to provide a more flexible and universal certification approach.\n\n6.  **Focus on Resolvable Transformations and Their Compositions:**\n\n    *   The paper specifically concentrates on *resolvable semantic transformations* (and compositions thereof).  This is a defined class of transformations with specific mathematical properties that allow for easier analysis and certification.  The framework's ability to handle *compositions* of these transformations is a significant contribution.\n\n7.  **Numerical Procedures for Certification:**\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes the development of *numerical procedures* for verifying the robustness of smoothed models.  This is important because analytical solutions are often intractable for complex transformations and models.  The authors propose a procedure that can be applied with \"little to no computation overhead.\"\n\n8.  **Benchmarking Against Existing Methods:**\n\n    *   The paper validates its approach by comparing it against state-of-the-art certification methods (TSS \\[28], MP \\[32], GS \\[16]) on standard image classification datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100).  This is crucial for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n\n9. **Limitations of Resolvable Transformations**:\n    * A major limitation of the proposed approach is that it is only suitable to certify models against resolvable perturbations, as conditional density may not be continuously differentiable with respect to the transformation parameter in the limit.\n\n**Specific References to Relevant Papers (Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe paper cites several relevant papers published in the last two years:\n\n*   **\\[2] Alfarra et al.

The focus on resolvable transformations and the development of efficient numerical certification procedures are notable aspects of the work. The paper's benchmarking against existing methods helps to position its contribution within the broader landscape of adversarial robustness research. The literature review in Section 6 further supports the findings extracted."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of information from the provided paper relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper primarily investigates the adversarial robustness of **Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) transformer models**. However, it does not explicitly discuss adversarial robustness trends in image classification separate from the multimodal context. Its focus is specifically on vulnerabilities that arise when *both* visual and textual modalities are present.\n\n**Key Findings and Contributions (Relevant to Adversarial Robustness in the VLP context):**\n\n*   **Novel Attack Method (JMTFA):** The paper introduces a new adversarial attack method called \"Joint Multimodal Transformer Feature Attack\" (JMTFA). This is a key contribution.\n    *   JMTFA simultaneously perturbs both visual and textual modalities, exploiting cross-modal interactions (specifically, targeting attention relevance scores) to disrupt important features.\n    *   It's a white-box attack, meaning the attacker has full knowledge of the model architecture and parameters.\n    *   The authors argue this approach is more effective than attacking each modality separately, leveraging the synergistic effect of cross-modality interaction.\n*   **Vulnerability of VLP Transformers:** The paper demonstrates that VLP transformers are vulnerable to adversarial examples generated by JMTFA. This vulnerability persists even after fine-tuning for downstream tasks.\n*   **Influence of Textual Modality:** The research indicates that the textual modality significantly influences the fusion processes within VLP transformers. In simpler terms, attacks on the text component can be very effective in misleading these models.\n*   **Model Size vs. Robustness:**  The authors found \"no apparent relationship\" between model size and adversarial robustness under the JMTFA attack.  This suggests that simply scaling up the model does not guarantee better resistance to this type of multimodal attack.\n*   **Architectural Differences:**  Complex network architectures (dual-stream) appear to rely more heavily on information from the textual modality than the visual modality.\n*   **Importance of Object Detection:** Object detection significantly enhances the intrinsic feature representation of objects. Improving regional features of the visual modality can achieve strong competitive adversarial robustness.\n*   **Effectiveness of Two-Source Perturbation:** Perturbing two-source modality are more effective than perturbing any single-source modality (image or text), demonstrating that stronger adversarial attacks are required when multiple modalities are involved.\n\n**Related Work (Trends and Existing Approaches):**\n\nThe paper cites several recent papers on adversarial attacks, which provide some context on current trends, but not explicitly as a summary:\n\n*   **Single Modality Attacks:**\n    *   **Vision Modality Attacks:** Mentions traditional adversarial attacks in computer vision, optimizing loss functions to perturb images (Szegedy et al.

Feature importance attacks [25, 26] and feature disruptive attacks [27] are also mentioned.\n    *   **Language Modality Attacks:**  Describes character-level [28-30], word-level [31-33], and sentence-level [34-36] perturbation techniques used to attack language models.\n*   **Adversarial Attacks on VLP Models:**\n    *   **Co-Attack [11]:** Attacks both image and text modalities collectively.\n    *   **VLATTACK [37]:** Uses block-wise similarity to enlarge the distance between original and perturbed image features, and BERT-Attack for text.\n    *   **SGA [38]:** Examines the transferability of adversarial examples in VLP transformers.\n    *   **SA-Attack [39]:** Uses self-augmentation to improve adversarial transferability.\n    *   **OT-Attack [40]:** Applies optimal transport theory to find correspondence between image and text features to improve transferability.\n*   **Limitations of Existing VLP Attacks:** The paper argues that existing multimodal attacks often overlook the learning of mutual connections between fused intrinsic features of vision and language modalities, which JMTFA addresses.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Models Evaluated:**\n\n*   **VLP Models Used:** ViLT, VisualBERT (single-stream), VLE, and LXMERT (dual-stream).\n*   **Datasets:** VQA v2 validation set and a Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset.\n*   **Attack Parameters:** PGD optimizer, perturbation budgets (epsilon), step sizes, iteration counts, BERT-Attack default settings for text.\n\n**Metrics Used:**\n\n*   Attack Success Rate (ASR)\n*   Adversarial Accuracy\n\n**Ablation Studies:**\n\n*   **Image Feature Layer Selection:** Investigated the impact of perturbing different layers of the VLP models.\n*   **Word Substitution Amount:** Analyzed the effect of varying the number of candidate word choices in textual attacks.\n*   **Parameter Iteration Analysis:** Examined how varying iteration numbers affected attack performance.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   The study focused on discriminative VLP transformers in classification challenges, not autoregressive generative VLP transformers.\n*   Generated adversarial text examples can sometimes include out-of-domain words.\n*   There exists a bias towards \u201cYes\u201d answers in VQA and \u201cTrue\u201d results in VSR tasks.\n*   When using BERT-attack for the language modality with K = 1, it fails to perform word substitutions, resulting in no improvement in attack performance for text inputs.\n\n**In summary, while the paper doesn't provide a broad overview of trends in *general* image classification adversarial robustness, it contributes significantly to understanding the unique challenges and recent advances in adversarial robustness of VLP models, which inherently involve image classification as one component.** The trend this paper is focused on is the increasing importance of cross-modal attacks when dealing with systems that process both images and text.\n\n**Note about the time frame:** While the paper itself does not explicitly state the years it is considering, the references indicate that the papers cited are mostly from 2019 onwards, implying that the background and related work are relatively recent.

The method improves both natural accuracy and robustness to various attacks.\n*   The gains in robustness are more significant for Group Normalization (GN) models, suggesting that GOR complements GN well, especially when regularizing according to the normalized groups.\n\n**Details Supporting the Finding (Adversarial Training):**\n\n*   **Method:** The authors evaluated the robustness of two adversarial training methods, TRADES [53] and FAT [54], when combined with GOR on CIFAR-10.\n*   **Attacks:** The trained models were tested against L\u221e bounded adversarial examples generated by:\n    *   FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)\n    *   PGD20 (Projected Gradient Descent, 20 iterations)\n    *   PGD100 (Projected Gradient Descent, 100 iterations)\n    *   CW\u221e (Carlini & Wagner L\u221e attack optimized by PGD20)\n    *   AutoAttack (an ensemble of APGD-CE, APGD-DLR, FAB [10] and Square [1] attacks)\n*   **Training Details:**\n    *   Wide ResNet [52] architecture was used, specifically WideResNet-34-10 for TRADES and WideResNet-32-10 for FAT.\n    *   GN models were created by replacing all BN layers with GN, with G = 32.\n    *   N = G = 32 was used for GOR configuration.\n    *   Inter-group regularization was used.\n*   **Results (Table 5):** The paper includes a table (Table 5) showing the test accuracy under different training methods on the CIFAR10 dataset under attacks bounded by L\u221e.\n    *   Models regulated by GOR show better natural accuracy.\n    *   Models regulated by GOR, in most cases, are more robust to attacks.\n    *   The gains are more significant for the GN models.\n\n**Key Elements of Group Orthogonalization Regularization (GOR) Explained**\n\n*   GOR encourages orthonormality between groups of filters within the same layer of a neural network. This is done by adding a regularization term to the loss function:\n    *   `Ltotal(W(1), ..., W(l)) = Ltask(W(1), ..., W(l)) + \u03bb \u03a3 \u03a3 ||W(i,l)^T W(i,l) - I||_F^2`\n        *   `Ltask`: The loss function for the specific task.\n        *   `W(l)`: Parameters of layer `l`.\n        *   `W(i,l)`: Flattened and stacked filters of the `i`th group in layer `l`.\n        *   `\u03bb`:  The regularization strength (a hyperparameter).\n        *   `I`: Identity matrix.\n        *   `||.||_F`: Frobenius norm.\n*   The method promotes filter diversity and reduces redundancy, leading to more expressive and robust models.  It's computationally efficient because it operates on groups of filters rather than all filters in a layer.\n\n**Inter-Group vs. Intra-Group Regularization:**\n\n*   The paper distinguishes between two approaches to group partitioning for GOR:\n    *   **Inter-Group:** Orthonormality is enforced on filters *within* the same group. The filters within the same group are enforced to form an orthonormal set.\n    *   **Intra-Group:** Orthonormality is enforced on filters *between* different groups. Enforces orthonormality between filters from different groups.\n*   The experiments primarily focus on **Inter-Group regularization** for adversarial robustness.\n\n**Relevance to Recent Trends (Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   The paper addresses a critical issue in deep learning: the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks.\n*   The use of adversarial training is a well-established defense mechanism. This paper contributes by showing how a novel regularization technique (GOR) can further enhance the effectiveness of adversarial training.\n*   The experiments use common attack methods (FGSM, PGD, CW, AutoAttack) for evaluating robustness, making the results relevant and comparable to other research in the field.\n*   The investigation into the combination of GOR with Group Normalization (GN) is interesting, as GN has become a popular alternative to Batch Normalization in many architectures.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work (as stated in the paper):**\n\n*   GOR introduces a new hyperparameter (\u03bb) that requires tuning. N might also need tuning for non-GN models.\n*   It introduces computational overhead proportional to the number of regularized layers, similar to other orthogonalization regularizations.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper makes a valuable contribution to adversarial robustness by demonstrating that Group Orthogonalization Regularization (GOR) can enhance the effectiveness of adversarial training. It is particularly effective when used in conjunction with Group Normalization. The paper provides experimental results on a standard dataset (CIFAR-10) and using common adversarial attack methods. This method is worth exploring as a defense mechanism for image classification models."

      "summary": "The paper \"TrackPGD: Efficient Adversarial Attack using Object Binary Masks against Robust Transformer Trackers\" presents a novel white-box attack, TrackPGD, designed to evaluate and compromise the adversarial robustness of transformer-based object trackers. Here's a detailed summary of the paper's relevance to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**Focus and Contributions:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Attack on Trackers:** The paper primarily focuses on adversarial attacks against visual object trackers, specifically those employing transformer backbones. While *not directly image classification*, it relates because the underlying components involve image processing and feature extraction, which are susceptible to adversarial perturbations similar to image classifiers.\n*   **TrackPGD:** It introduces a new white-box attack called TrackPGD. This attack leverages predicted object binary masks to craft adversarial perturbations. The aim is to mislead the tracker into producing inaccurate binary masks of the tracked object.\n*   **Targeted Robustness Evaluation:** The core purpose of TrackPGD is to assess the adversarial robustness of modern transformer-based trackers. These trackers have shown strong performance but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks hasn't been thoroughly investigated.\n*   **Applicability:** It addresses limitations of existing white-box attacks, which are often not universally applicable to different tracker architectures (especially transformer-based ones). TrackPGD overcomes this by utilizing object binary masks, a common output in modern trackers.\n*   **Novel Loss Function:** The method proposes a new loss term, built upon SegPGD, tailored for binary mask-based attacks. This loss function aims to manipulate the tracker's ability to generate accurate binary masks, addressing challenges like limited class numbers (only object/background) and pixel class imbalance (more background than object pixels).\n\n**Key Findings and Insights (Relevant to Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   **Vulnerability of Transformer Trackers:** The paper demonstrates that transformer trackers, despite their advancements, *are* susceptible to adversarial attacks. TrackPGD is shown to effectively degrade their performance.\n*   **Importance of Attack Proxy:** The choice of attack proxy (the element used to compute the adversarial loss) is crucial. TrackPGD uses the object binary mask, which proves effective against trackers that rely on mask prediction. Other proxies, like bounding boxes or classification labels, may not be as effective against all architectures.\n*   **Effectiveness of TrackPGD:** Experimental results show that TrackPGD significantly reduces the accuracy, average overlap, and robustness of trackers like MixFormerM, OSTrackSTS, TransT-SEG, and RTS. These reductions are demonstrated on datasets like VOT2022STS, DAVIS2016, UAV123, and GOT-10k.\n*   **Comparison to Existing Attacks:** TrackPGD is compared to existing attacks like IoU, CSA, SPARK, and RTAA. It is shown to be more effective than existing white-box attacks against transformer trackers. Some black-box attacks like IoU are applicable but less effective.\n\n**Details from the paper showing the effectiveness of TrackPGD**\n\n*   **Table 1:** Shows that TrackPGD is applicable to a wider range of trackers (MixFormerM, OSTrackSTS, TransT-SEG, RTS) compared to other white-box attacks.\n*   **Table 2:** Demonstrates the performance degradation caused by TrackPGD on MixFormerM and OSTrackSTS on the VOT-STS2022 dataset. For example, TrackPGD reduces the robustness of MixFormerM by approximately 91% and causes higher degradations to EAO, accuracy, and AUC compared to IoU and CSA attacks.\n*   **Table 3:** Shows the attack results on TransT-SEG and RTS trackers using the GOT-10k dataset, where TrackPGD achieves competitive performance compared to other attacks, despite focusing on manipulating object binary masks.\n*   **Table 4:** Assesses the TransT-SEG and RTS trackers' robustness on the UAV123 dataset after applying TrackPGD and other white-box attacks, showing that TrackPGD achieves competitive scores and is the first white-box attack applicable to the RTS tracker.\n*   **Table 5:** Demonstrates the effectiveness of TrackPGD in reducing the Jaccard index J(M)% (a measure of overlap between predicted and annotated binary masks) when attacking MixFormerM on the DAVIS2016 dataset, compared to using vanilla SegPGD losses.\n*   **Table 6:** Shows the impact of different loss terms (focal and dice losses) in the TrackPGD attack, demonstrating that focal loss is more effective than dice loss in reducing the J&F(M)% values (Jaccard index and contour accuracy) on the DAVIS2016 dataset.\n*   **Figure 1:** Illustrates the effectiveness of TrackPGD in disrupting binary masks of MixFormerM and OSTrackSTS, where the masks are significantly changed after the attack compared to the Intersection over Union (IoU) method.\n*   **Figure 2:** Shows the essential role of the proposed combination loss L\u0394 in crashing the object mask inferred by MixFormerM, compared to using vanilla SegPGD losses.\n*   **Figure 3:** Shows heatmaps of the average Jaccard index J and contour accuracy F for the tracker's recall metric, used to fine-tune the TrackPGD parameters, indicating the optimal coefficients of TrackPGD loss for different trackers.\n*   **Figure 4:** Presents qualitative results of TrackPGD generating inaccurate binary masks for MixFormerM, RTS, and OSTrackSTS trackers on successive frames of video sequences.\n*   **Figure 5:** Illustrates the bounding box evaluation of the TransT-SEG tracker in several frames, showing that TrackPGD significantly degrades the target bounding boxes, even though the perturbation is generated based on the binary mask.\n*   **Algorithm 1:** Presents the principle steps of the TrackPGD algorithm, explaining how the adversarial example is updated based on the computed TrackPGD loss.\n\n**How this relates to Image Classification robustness trends (within the last 2 years):**\n\nWhile the paper doesn't directly deal with *image classification*, it touches upon several themes relevant to adversarial robustness in that domain:\n\n*   **Transferability:** Though not explicitly studied in this paper, adversarial attacks are often designed to transfer between different architectures.  The fact that TrackPGD can compromise transformer-based *trackers* hints at potential vulnerabilities that might also exist in transformer-based *image classifiers*.\n*   **Importance of Attack Strategy:** The paper highlights the importance of designing attacks that are tailored to the specific architecture and output of the target network. This mirrors the trend in image classification where attacks are increasingly specialized for different classifier types (e.g., CNNs vs. Transformers).\n*   **White-box vs. Black-box:** The paper underscores the power of white-box attacks when evaluating robustness. White-box attacks, which leverage internal network information (gradients), are generally more effective at exposing vulnerabilities than black-box attacks. This aligns with the understanding in the image classification field.\n*   **Defense Implications:** While the paper focuses on attacks, it mentions potential defense strategies like adversarial training or adversarial purification using generative models. These are common defense techniques also explored in the context of image classification.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   The paper's direct relevance to *image classification* is limited, as its primary focus is on object tracking. However, the underlying principles and techniques have overlaps.\n*   The paper focuses on a specific attack (TrackPGD) and a specific type of output (binary masks). It doesn't provide a broad overview of all the latest trends in adversarial robustness.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThis paper contributes to the field of adversarial robustness by introducing a novel white-box attack specifically designed for transformer-based object trackers. While the paper itself does not deal with image classification, the concepts of adversarial robustness, transferability, attack strategy, and defense implications are all relevant. The paper demonstrates that despite the strong performance of transformer trackers, they are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks."

It leverages knowledge distillation with multiple teacher models that differ in their architecture or adversarial training algorithm to improve adversarial robustness.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question:** The paper directly addresses adversarial robustness in image classification and presents a novel approach. The paper includes several citations from the last two years, and appears to be from 2023 (judging from the arXiv version dates). Therefore, the paper is useful to the research question.\n\n**Detailed Extraction of Relevant Information:**\n\n*   **Problem Addressed:** The vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial examples remains a critical issue preventing their deployment in safety-critical applications.\n*   **Existing Approaches and Their Limitations:**\n    *   **Adversarial Training:**  Considered one of the most effective empirical defenses, but still has room for improvement. The paper cites works that discuss adversarial training techniques.\n    *   **Adversarial Distillation:** Knowledge distillation, where a robust \"teacher\" model transfers its robustness to a \"student\" model, is a promising direction. Existing methods use either a single teacher or combine a vanilla and adversarially trained teacher. The paper cites recent advances in adversarial distillation. A few of the important methods are:\n        *   **Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD) [Zi et al., 2021]:** Incorporates robust soft labels from an adversarially trained teacher. Achieves good robust accuracy but not necessarily the best clean accuracy.\n        *   **Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robustness Distillation (MTARD) [Zhao et al., 2022, 2023]:**  Uses both an adversarially trained and a vanilla teacher to balance clean and robust accuracy.  Requires hyperparameter tuning.\n*   **DARHT's Novelty and Contributions:**\n    *   **Heterogeneous Teachers:** DARHT uses multiple teacher models that are heterogeneous, meaning they differ in either architecture (e.g., CNNs and Vision Transformers) or adversarial training algorithm. The paper explicitly hypothesizes that such diversity can lead to better robustness due to \"complementary robustness\" (teachers robust to different adversarial subspaces).\n    *   **Student-Teacher Feature Map:** The student model explicitly represents the logits of each teacher in a \"student-teacher feature map.\"\n    *   **Adaptive Teacher Weighting:**  DARHT weights the distillation loss from each teacher by the inverse of its cross-entropy loss, avoiding per-teacher hyperparameter tuning.\n    *   **Monte Carlo Dropout:**  Implemented in the student model to further improve generalization and robustness.\n*   **Key Findings/Experimental Results:**\n    *   **Improved Robustness:**  DARHT achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Specifically, it demonstrates significant improvements in \"weighted robust accuracy\" (average of robust and clean accuracy) against strong attacks like Auto-PGD and Square Attack compared to RSLAD and MTARD.\n        *   For Auto-PGD, DARHT achieves at least 3.26%, 3.66%, and 25.75% improvements in weighted robust accuracy for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, respectively.\n        *   For Square Attack, DARHT achieves at least 5.23%, 4.76%, and 22.83% improvements in weighted robust accuracy for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, respectively.\n    *   **Benefits of Heterogeneity:** Experiments show that using architecturally diverse teachers (CNNs and Vision Transformers) leads to increased robustness compared to using only CNNs or only Vision Transformers. Teachers trained by different adversarial training algorithms also help.\n    *   **Reduced Transferability:** DARHT reduces the transferability of adversarial examples from the student model to the teacher models, suggesting that the diverse teacher set helps the student learn more robust features.\n    * Compared to FAT which was used to adversarially train DARHT teachers, DARHT-WRN-32 achieved notable improvements of 9.69% for PGD and 10.42% for CW\u221e.\n\n*   **Datasets & Attacks Used:**\n    *   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet\n    *   **White-box Attacks:** FGSM, PGD, CW\u221e, Auto-PGD\n    *   **Black-box Attack:** Square Attack\n\n*   **Teacher Architectures:** ResNet-164s, vision transformers (ViTs), and WideResNets (WRNs)\n\n**In summary, DARHT represents a notable trend in adversarial robustness research by:**\n\n1.  **Emphasizing knowledge distillation as a defense strategy.**\n2.  **Highlighting the importance of teacher diversity (heterogeneity in architecture and training) in adversarial distillation.**\n3.  **Focusing on achieving a balance between clean accuracy and robust accuracy (weighted robust accuracy).**\n4.  **Demonstrating strong empirical results against state-of-the-art attacks.**"

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper, accepted in February 2024, directly addresses adversarial robustness. However, it focuses on *unsupervised* learning (specifically, k-means clustering) rather than *supervised* image classification. Therefore, its *direct* relevance to the question is limited. Nevertheless, it contains information about adversarial robustness techniques that, while applied to a different context, could potentially be relevant to image classification.\n\n**Relevant Information and Trends (with caveats):**\n\nGiven the focus on unsupervised learning, I will extrapolate any potentially transferable insights related to general adversarial robustness techniques.\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training for Unsupervised Learning:**\n    *   The paper introduces an adversarial training algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of a k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm manipulates the proportion of clean and perturbed samples in the training data and iteratively trains the k-means model.\n    *   *Relevance to Image Classification:* While the direct application to k-means is not the focus, the concept of manipulating data distributions during training to improve robustness against adversarial examples *is* a core trend in supervised adversarial robustness.\n    *   Key components include:\n        *   Proportion control (\u03b7): Balancing clean and adversarial examples in the training set is crucial.  They found a proportion of \u03b7 = 1/2 or \u03b7 = 2/3 adversarial examples resulted in competitive performance for both datasets, with the former having slightly better clean test accuracy and the latter having slightly better adversarial testing accuracy.\n        *   Incremental training (Adversarial step-count \u03b2): Gradually increasing the attack strength during training is important.  The paper increments training attack strength \u03f5 values at each step s with \u03f5 = s/\u03b2, where \u03b2 is the maximum number of steps or alternatively referred to as the adversarial step-count.\n        *   Continuous learning: Initializing cluster centroids from the previous training step helps stabilize learning.\n\n2.  **Transferability of Adversarial Examples:**\n    *   The paper demonstrates that adversarial examples generated from a *supervised* model (ResNet-18 trained on MNIST) can successfully attack an *unsupervised* model (k-means) trained on Fashion-MNIST.\n    *   *Relevance to Image Classification:* The concept of transferability is very relevant.  The paper cites prior work (\\[12], \\[15], \\[34], \\[35], \\[36], \\[37], \\[38], \\[39], \\[40], \\[41]) that explores transferability of evasion attacks against surrogate models in a limited-knowledge scenario and the observation that different models might learn intersecting decision boundaries in both benign and adversarial dimensions. This means adversarial attacks crafted for one model can be effective against other models, even those with different architectures or trained on different datasets. This has implications for black-box attacks and defense strategies in image classification.\n    *   Specifically,  Biggio et al. [12] were the first to consider evasion attacks against surrogate models in a limited-knowledge scenario, while Goodfellow et al. [15], Tramer et al. [40], and Moosavi et al. [41] were some of the first to make the observation that different models might learn intersecting decision boundaries in both benign and adversarial dimensions.\n\n3.  **Surrogate Models:**\n    * The paper uses a pre-trained supervised model (ResNet-18) as a surrogate to generate adversarial examples for the k-means clustering.\n    *   *Relevance to Image Classification:* Using surrogate models to approximate the loss function is a common technique in adversarial training, especially when the target model is difficult to directly attack or analyze.\n\n4.  **I-FGSM Attack:**\n    *   The paper utilizes the Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM) to generate adversarial examples.\n    *   *Relevance to Image Classification:* I-FGSM is a well-established and widely used attack in the field of adversarial robustness for image classification. The paper's use of I-FGSM reinforces its continued relevance as a benchmark attack.\n\n5.  **Trade-off between Robustness and Accuracy:**\n    *   The paper observes a trade-off between robustness against adversarial attacks and performance on clean data.  As the model is made more robust, its performance on clean data tends to degrade, although the paper mentions only slight degradation in their case.\n    *   *Relevance to Image Classification:* This trade-off is a fundamental challenge in adversarial robustness for image classification. Any new trends in defenses must address this balance.\n\n6.  **Sensitivity to Sample Distributions:**\n    *   The paper highlights the sensitivity of unsupervised models to the proportion of clean and adversarial examples in the training set.\n    *   *Relevance to Image Classification:* While this sensitivity might be more pronounced in unsupervised learning, the composition of the training data is still critical in supervised learning for achieving adversarial robustness.\n\n**Citations and Related Work (within the last 2 years):**\n\nThe paper cites several works that, while not necessarily *trends*, represent the existing landscape:\n\n*   **CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology, vol. 6, no. 1, pp. 25\u201345, 2021**: A survey on adversarial attacks and defenses.\n*   **IEEE Access, vol. 8, pp. 35 403\u201335 419, 2020**: Adversarial machine learning applied to intrusion and malware scenarios: a systematic review.\n*   **Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 34, no. 04, 2020**: Suspicion-free adversarial attacks on clustering algorithms.\n*   **Computer, vol. 54, no. 5, pp. 56\u201360, 2021**: Adversarial machine learning: Attacks from laboratories to the real world.\n*   **2023 IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML)**: \"real attackers don\u2019t compute gradients\u201d: Bridging the gap between adversarial ml research and practice.\n*   **Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.

This approach offers several potential advantages for robustness:\n\n*   **Data Diversity:** FL inherently leverages data diversity from different clients, which can help the model generalize better and become less susceptible to overfitting to specific adversarial patterns.\n*   **Privacy Preservation:** FL mitigates data exposure, as model updates are exchanged instead of raw data.\n*   **Defense against Data Poisoning:** By aggregating models from multiple clients, FL can potentially mitigate the impact of data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious data into the training set.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Approaches Mentioned:**\n\nThe paper proposes a specific federated learning framework tailored for adversarial robustness in the context of autonomous landing runway detection (ALRD). Here's a breakdown of the key components and how they relate to the broader trend of adversarial robustness:\n\n1.  **Federated Adversarial Learning (FAL):** The core idea is to incorporate adversarial training into the federated learning process. Each client trains its local model not only on clean data but also on adversarial examples generated from the clean data.\n2.  **Scale and Shift Deep Features (SSF):** This is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method applied to a pre-trained model. Instead of training the entire model on each client, only the scale and shift parameters are fine-tuned.\n    *   *Relevance to Robustness:* SSF helps in leveraging large-scale pre-trained models while minimizing communication costs in FL. By fine-tuning on both clean and adversarial data using SSF, the local models become more robust to adversarial perturbations.\n3.  **Adversarial Feature Learning (AFL):** The paper explicitly aims to disentangle the feature distributions of clean and adversarial images.\n    *   *Relevance to Robustness:* This disentanglement helps the model learn more robust features that are less sensitive to adversarial perturbations. The paper uses different normalization techniques (Batch Normalization (BN) for clean images and Random Normalization Aggregation (RNA) for adversarial images) to achieve this.\n4. **Pre-training:** The local model is pre-trained on a large-scale lane detection dataset. This leverages transfer learning to improve performance and robustness.\n5. **Central Model Update:** The central model is updated by aggregating the parameters of the local models. The SSF pools are aggregated into the central model.\n\n**Adversarial Attacks Considered:**\n\nThe paper acknowledges the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks and mentions several common attack algorithms:\n\n*   Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)\n*   Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)\n*   Semantic Similarity Attack on High-Frequency Components (SSAH)\n*   Carlini & Wagner (CW)\n*   DeepFool\n*   Basic Iterative Method (BIM)\n*   Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack\n\n**Competitors and Baselines:**\n\nThe paper compares its proposed method against several baseline approaches, including:\n\n*   Traditional ALRD methods (LSTM, LSD, RDS, CS-ResNet)\n*   Other Federated Learning frameworks (FedAvg, FedProx, FedDC, SiloBN + ASAM)\n\nThe comparison highlights the superior robustness of the proposed FAL approach against adversarial attacks, especially when compared to non-federated methods.\n\n**Key Takeaways and Trends (Based on the paper):**\n\n*   **Federated learning is emerging as a promising approach for improving the adversarial robustness of image classification models.** The distributed nature of FL, coupled with techniques like adversarial training and feature disentanglement, can lead to more robust models.\n*   **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as SSF, are crucial for enabling federated learning in resource-constrained environments.**\n*   **Explicitly addressing the different feature distributions of clean and adversarial images is a key factor in achieving robustness.** The paper's use of AFL with different normalization techniques demonstrates this point.\n*   **Transfer learning through pre-training on related datasets can boost the performance and robustness of federated models.**\n*   **Combination of Batch Normalization and Random Normalization Aggregation provides optimal results for adversarial robustness**\n\n**Limitations (Based on the paper):**\n\n*   The paper focuses specifically on autonomous landing runway detection (ALRD), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other image classification tasks.\n*   The paper acknowledges that federated learning methods can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks if an adversary can inject malicious data during training.\n\n**In summary,** the paper contributes to the growing trend of using federated learning to enhance adversarial robustness in image classification. It proposes a specific FAL framework with SSF and AFL that achieves state-of-the-art results in the context of ALRD. The paper's findings suggest that federated learning, combined with appropriate adversarial training and feature learning techniques, can be an effective strategy for building more secure and reliable image classification systems."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years, as requested.\n\n**Overall Summary**\n\nThe paper \"FreqFed: A Frequency Analysis-Based Approach for Mitigating Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning\" (NDSS Symposium 2024) presents a defense mechanism against poisoning attacks in federated learning (FL) called FreqFed. While the main focus is on defending against poisoning attacks in the context of federated learning, there are some pieces of information that we can extract to address your research question, related to recent trends in adversarial robustness, specifically concerning image classification. The paper itself is more about *defending* against attacks, but it references and compares against other defenses. I will focus on the aspects that involve image classification and its robustness.\n\n**Key Information Extracted for the Research Question:**\n\n1.  **Attack Types Considered:**\n    *   The paper evaluates FreqFed against both untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks. This is important, because these attacks are used to measure adversarial robustness:\n        *   **Untargeted Attacks:**\n            *   Label Flipping [47]\n            *   Random Updates [61]\n            *   Optimized attack (Projected Gradient Descent, PGD) [28]\n        *   **Targeted Attacks (Backdoor Attacks):**\n            *   Constrain-and-Scale [4]\n            *   Edge-case (PGD) [51]\n            *   Distributed Backdoor Attacks (DBA) [57], [58]\n\n2.  **Image Classification Datasets:**\n    *   The paper uses common image classification datasets for evaluation, which indicates a standard benchmark for assessing adversarial robustness. These include:\n        *   MNIST [25]\n        *   EMNIST [13]\n        *   Cifar-10 [23]\n\n3.  **Image Classification Models:**\n    *   The paper explicitly mentions using the following models for image classification:\n        *   ResNet-18 Light (for Cifar-10)\n        *   CNN (for MNIST)\n        *   LeNet (for EMNIST)\n\n4.  **Benchmark Defenses:**\n    *   FreqFed is compared against existing defense mechanisms, offering insight into current approaches.\n    *   Krum [6]\n    *   AFA [34]\n    *   Median [61]\n    *   DP (Differential Privacy) [31]\n    *   FoolsGold [16]\n    *   BayBFed [24]\n    *   FLAME [38]\n    *   DeepSight [44]\n    *   Auror [47]\n    *   3DFed [26]\n\n5.  **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   The paper uses standard metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the defense against attacks. These metrics are also used to evaluate adversarial robustness.\n        *   **Backdoor Accuracy (BA):**  Measures the model's accuracy on triggered (attacked) inputs.  Also referred to as Attack Success Rate.\n        *   **Main Task Accuracy (MA):** Measures the model's accuracy on benign (normal) inputs.\n\n6. **Trends and Limitations in Existing Defenses (as described in the paper):**\n\n*   **Dependence on Data Distribution Assumptions:**  Many defenses rely on assumptions about the client data distributions (e.g., IID or non-IID). This limits their generalizability. Defenses may perform poorly when data distributions deviate from these assumptions. \\[61], [6], [9], [27]\n*   **Vulnerability to Adaptive Attacks:** Defenses against backdoor attacks can often be bypassed by adaptive attacks, such as multiple backdoors, distributed backdoors, and advanced techniques like Constrain-and-Scale and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). [4], [57], [51], [52]\n*   **Inspection of Model Weights:** Many defenses directly inspect or compute using models' weights (e.g., using output predictions, intermediary states, or norms). This can be circumvented by adversaries who manipulate the model's weights to influence defense-related metrics. [4], [52]\n*   **Differential Privacy Trade-offs:**  Defenses using Differential Privacy (DP) add noise to the weights, which can decrease the model's overall utility. [4], [31], [35]\n\n7. **Adaptation of Frequency Domain Attacks:**\n    *The evaluation adapts frequency domain attacks from Zhai et al. \\[63] and Wang et al. \\[53] to federated settings, which could be a new trend for robust image classifers.\n    *One way this can happen is through the use of covert triggers in the low frequency representation of audio \\[63] or the injection of frequency triggers \\[53].\n\n**How This Information Addresses the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Attack Landscape:** The paper provides a snapshot of current attack vectors considered relevant in the federated learning and, by extension, adversarial robustness space.  The mentioned attacks (Label Flipping, PGD, Constrain-and-Scale, DBA, etc.) are techniques used to *compromise* robustness.\n*   **Benchmarking:** The use of standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, EMNIST) highlights common grounds for comparing the effectiveness of different defense/robustness strategies.\n*   **Model Choices:** The models employed (ResNet, CNN, LeNet) represent common architectures used in image classification, giving insight into the models researchers are trying to make robust.\n*   **Defense Limitations:** The listed limitations of existing defenses point to areas where current adversarial robustness techniques for image classification are lacking.  Specifically, the sensitivity to data distribution, vulnerability to adaptive attacks, and trade-offs with privacy.\n*   **FreqFed as a Potential Trend:** While the paper promotes FreqFed, the method itself (frequency domain analysis of model weights) *could* be seen as part of a trend towards defenses that operate on different representations of model information rather than directly on the data or model predictions, thus decoupling from specific data distributions or attack strategies.\n\n**Limitations of This Paper for Answering the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Federated Learning Focus:** The paper's primary focus is federated learning. While relevant to adversarial robustness in a distributed setting, it doesn't directly address all aspects of adversarial robustness for image classification in general.\n*   **Defense-Oriented:** The paper is about a defense mechanism. While it provides context by mentioning other defenses and attacks, it doesn't offer a comprehensive survey of the *latest research* specifically on adversarial robustness techniques themselves.\n*   **Limited Scope:** The paper provides information about specific attacks and defenses, but it doesn't provide a broad overview of all recent trends in adversarial robustness.\n\nIn summary, this paper is helpful in understanding some *current* trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, especially those related to defending against poisoning attacks in federated learning. Specifically, it touches on relevant attacks, benchmark datasets and models, and limitations of current defenses."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of information from the provided paper relevant to the research question \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper, titled \"Fed-Safe: Securing Federated Learning in Healthcare Against Adversarial Attacks,\" primarily addresses the challenge of ensuring both adversarial robustness *and* privacy in federated learning (FL) systems applied to medical image analysis.  It highlights the robustness-privacy trade-off inherent in traditional adversarial training methods.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Trends in Adversarial Robustness):**\n\nWhile the paper's *main* contribution isn't a novel *image classification* architecture or a comprehensive survey of all adversarial robustness techniques, it *does* touch on relevant trends, specifically within the context of *federated learning* and *medical imaging*. Here's how:\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training in Federated Learning:**\n    *   The paper identifies adversarial training as \"the most popular technique for mitigating the impact of adversarial attacks\" within federated networks (FL). This confirms adversarial training is a significant trend.\n    *   It also acknowledges that applying adversarial training to individual clients in FL increases the computational burden and can lead to convergence issues due to model heterogeneity [17].\n\n2.  **Robustness-Privacy Trade-off:**\n    *   A key theme is the inherent conflict between adversarial robustness and privacy. The paper points out that adversarial training can *amplify* the effectiveness of privacy attacks (model inversion, data reconstruction, GAN-based attacks) [1\u20133]. This is a critical consideration in the field.\n    *   The paper frames the research question as: \"Is the protection against adversarial attacks worth the high cost to privacy?\" This highlights the need for methods that address both.\n\n3.  **Distributed Noise for Robustness and Privacy:**\n    *   The paper's core proposal is using \"distributed noise\" to achieve both adversarial robustness *and* guaranteed privacy in federated learning.\n    *   The method involves:\n        *   Generating synthetic adversarial samples on a global server for adversarial adaptation.\n        *   Adding Gaussian noise to the downlink channel (server to clients).\n    *   The goal is to make the network resilient to adversarial clients and protect against reverse-engineering attacks on the global model.\n\n4.  **Adversarial Sample Generation Techniques:**\n    *   The paper mentions specific techniques for generating adversarial examples:\n        *   **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM):** A single-step method involving adding a perturbation to the input based on the gradient of the loss function [19].  The formula is given:\n            *   `xadv = x + \u03f5 sign(\u2207xL(\u03b8, x, y))`\n        *   **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD):** An iterative, multi-step method that builds upon FGSM, generally producing stronger adversarial examples but is more computationally expensive [20,21]. The formula is given:\n            *   `x[i+1] = clip(x[i] + \u03b1 sign(\u2207xi L(\u03b8, x[i], y))`\n\n5.  **Federated Averaging (FedAvg):**\n    *   The paper uses Federated Averaging as the model aggregation method. This technique is commonly used in federated learning to create a global model by averaging the locally trained models from different clients.\n\n6.  **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   The paper uses clean accuracy and attack success rate (ASR) to measure the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Clean accuracy measures the model's performance on uncorrupted images, while ASR measures how effectively the adversary can change the model's predicted labels [11].\n    *   Attack accuracy (AA) shows the accuracy of an adversary after performing an attack, and transferability measures the effectiveness of attacks on target models.\n\n7.  **Experimental Results and Comparisons:**\n    *   The paper compares its distributed noise approach with traditional adversarial training.\n    *   The results show that distributed noise training can reduce the attacker\u2019s self-ASR and average ASR compared to adversarial training (Table 1).\n\n**Limitations and Caveats:**\n\n*   **Federated Learning Focus:** The paper is primarily about *federated learning*, so its discussion of adversarial robustness is scoped to that specific context. It doesn't provide a broad overview of all recent advances in adversarial robustness for image classification in general.\n*   **Medical Imaging Specific:** The experiments and datasets used are within the medical imaging domain (brain cancer MRI, histopathology). The findings may not directly translate to other image classification tasks.\n*   **Limited Scope of Comparison:** The primary comparison is between distributed noise and traditional adversarial training. It doesn't benchmark against a wider range of state-of-the-art adversarial defense techniques.\n\n**Papers cited from the last 2 years (relevant to the research question):**\n\n*   **[1] J. Zhang, Y.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper, focusing on adversarial robustness trends for image classification within the last two years:\n\n**Core Idea of the Paper (and Relevance to the Question):**\n\nThe paper addresses the challenge of adversarial robustness in Federated Learning (FL) for image classification in edge networks.  It specifically targets scenarios with non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, which is common in federated settings. The paper proposes a new framework called Federated hyBrid Adversarial training and self-adversarial disTillation (FedBAT).  FedBAT aims to improve robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining high accuracy, which are competing goals in adversarial robustness research.  The techniques used in the paper are relevant to the research question because they describe concrete methods for improving robustness, and the paper was published in 2024.\n\n**Key Contributions & Techniques (Addressing the Research Question):**\n\nThe paper's two core components are designed to improve adversarial robustness:\n\n1.  **Federated Hybrid Adversarial Training (Hybrid-AT):**\n\n    *   **Trend Addressed:** This strategy directly counters the accuracy vs. robustness trade-off that is a major trend and challenge in adversarial robustness. Vanilla Adversarial Training often increases robustness at the cost of accuracy on clean (unperturbed) images.\n    *   **Technique:** Hybrid-AT combines standard training (on clean examples) and adversarial training (on adversarial examples) in each client's local update.\n    *   **Mechanism:** It uses two training branches: one for clean accuracy (CA) and one for robust accuracy (RA).  A coefficient `lambda` balances the importance of each branch, allowing tuning of the trade-off.\n\n2.  **Augmentation-Invariant Self-Adversarial Distillation (ASD):**\n\n    *   **Trend Addressed:** This addresses the non-IID data problem.  Non-IID data distributions across clients can cause local models to diverge, hindering the global model's generalization and robustness.  Knowledge Distillation is a method which has shown promise in improving generalization performance of models trained on Non-IID data.\n    *   **Technique:** Regularizes each client's local updates by aligning local adversarial representations with corresponding *global* clean representations.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        *   **Global Representation:** The server averages local representations (embeddings) of clean images *after applying random data augmentations* across different clients. Data augmentation has been shown to improve adversarial robustness.\n        *   **Alignment:** The local updates are then regularized by minimizing the difference (using MSE loss) between local adversarial representations and the corresponding global clean representations.  The idea is that global representations are less biased than local ones, keeping local updates closer to the global optimum and promoting consistency.\n        *   **Augmentation Invariance:** The method encourages learning augmentation-invariant knowledge. In other words, semantically similar images from different clients should be close in the representation space, even if the images have been augmented.\n\n**Why these Techniques Relate to Current Trends:**\n\n*   **Addressing the Trade-off:** Hybrid-AT is a direct response to the ongoing challenge of balancing accuracy and robustness.  Many recent papers in adversarial robustness focus on methods to mitigate this trade-off.\n*   **Federated Learning and Non-IID Data:**  Federated learning is an increasingly important area, and the non-IID data problem is a major focus.  Techniques like knowledge distillation and regularization are common approaches to address this in federated settings.\n*   **Data Augmentation:** Has been shown to improve robustness and generalization performance.\n*   **Self-Distillation/Knowledge Distillation:** The ASD component leverages self-distillation, a specific type of knowledge distillation, a model compression technique that enhances the performance and efficiency of smaller student models by transferring knowledge from more complex teacher models.  Knowledge distillation, particularly adversarial knowledge distillation, is an active area of research for improving robustness.\n*   **Defense against Strong Attacks:** The paper tests against a range of attacks, including AutoAttack (AA), which is considered a strong and comprehensive attack, ensuring the defense is evaluated rigorously.\n\n**Experimental Results & Baselines (Important for Context):**\n\n*   **Datasets:** The paper evaluates on standard image classification datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, Office-Amazon, and CIFAR-10.\n*   **Baselines:** It compares against:\n    *   Standard Federated Learning (FedAvg)\n    *   Federated Adversarial Training (FAT) variants: FedPGD, FedALP, FedAVMIXUP, FedTRADES\n    *   State-of-the-art federated defense methods: MixFAT, CalFAT, DBFAT\n*   **Metrics:** The key metrics are Clean Accuracy (CA) and Robust Accuracy (RA), measured under various adversarial attacks (FGSM, BIM, PGD, CW, Square, AA).\n*   **Results:** FedBAT achieves comparable or superior performance compared to the baselines, indicating the effectiveness of the hybrid-AT and ASD approach.\n\n**Important Details:**\n\n*   **Non-IID Data Simulation:** The paper simulates non-IID data using a Dirichlet distribution, a standard technique to control the degree of data heterogeneity.\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Ablation studies are included to show the contribution of each component of the FedBAT framework.\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The paper explores the impact of the `lambda` hyperparameter (which balances the hybrid training), showing the accuracy-robustness trade-off.\n\n**Limitations (Important to Consider for Future Research):**\n\nThe paper acknowledges some limitations which point to further research directions:\n\n*   **Scalability:** While a scalability comparison is done, further testing with truly massive numbers of clients would be valuable.\n*   **Specific Architectures:** The experiments are primarily conducted using a multi-layer CNN architecture. It would be helpful to see how FedBAT performs with other model architectures, such as Transformers.\n*   **Specific Attacks:** The paper focuses on specific white-box and black-box attacks. Exploring robustness against other types of attacks (e.g., backdoor attacks) would be worthwhile.\n*   **Computational Cost:** The complexity analysis provides a good overview but a more detailed breakdown of the computational overhead of FedBAT compared to simpler FAT methods would be helpful.\n\n**In summary,** the paper presents a novel approach to improve adversarial robustness in federated learning by using a hybrid adversarial training scheme and augmentation-invariant self-adversarial distillation. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness when compared to several baselines. This paper aligns with current trends in adversarial robustness by specifically addressing the accuracy-robustness trade-off, and the challenges introduced by Non-IID data in Federated Learning, an increasingly important area."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a highly detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper, specifically addressing the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\" I'm focusing on content published since late 2022.\n\n**I. General Overview and Scope (Relevant Context)**\n\n*   **Focus:** The paper is a survey of neural network robustness assessment in image recognition, covering both adversarial robustness (AR) and corruption robustness (CR).  It emphasizes concepts, metrics, and assessment methods.\n*   **Timeframe:** Mentions a search of over 3,000 documents spanning from 1975 to 2023, with an analysis of over 400 papers related to robustness verification, testing, and assessment.  It also contains some references from 2024.\n*   **Key Areas:**  Concepts, metrics (perturbation and robustness), and assessment methods (verification and testing).\n*   **Keywords:** Robustness assessment, neural network verification, neural network testing, adversarial attacks, data corruptions, image recognition.\n\n**II. Key Concepts and Definitions (Relevant to Trend Identification)**\n\n*   **Robustness Definition (General):** The ability of an AI system to maintain its level of performance under any circumstances, including external interference or harsh environmental conditions (ISO/IEC DIS 25059:2022).  Emphasizes the quantitative aspect of robustness.\n*   **Focus on Input Data:**  Existing research primarily focuses on robustness to abnormal input data, including unseen, biased, adversarial, or invalid data.\n*   **Adversarial Robustness (AR) vs. Corruption Robustness (CR):**  *AR* addresses deliberate attacks through crafted adversarial examples. *CR* focuses on unintended changes in data, such as noise or distributional shifts.  It frames AR as a security concern and CR as a safety issue.\n*   **Semantic Robustness:** This emerging concept looks at robustness against semantic perturbations (e.g., rotation, scaling, cropping, tilting). Emphasizes perturbations on semantic features rather than pixel-level modifications. It is related to both AR and CR.\n\n**III. Metrics and Measurement (Key to Understanding Current Approaches)**\n\n*   **Local vs. Global Robustness:** *Local robustness* is the model's ability to maintain its output within specific regions in the input space (e.g., near a specific sample). *Global robustness* is the model's overall robustness across the entire input space.\n*   **Robustness Bounds (Local):**\n    *   **Exact Bound:** The smallest perturbation that changes the model's output.\n    *   **Lower Bound:** A smaller radius than the exact bound, guaranteeing robustness within that smaller region.\n    *   **Upper Bound:** The minimum perturbation degree generated by adversarial attack algorithms.  Pointwise robustness is a metric for this.\n*   **Probabilistic Robustness:**  Quantifies robustness using a statistical approach, calculating the probability that the model remains correct within an acceptable range of perturbations.  A move away from worst-case analysis.\n*   **Global Robustness Metrics:**\n    *   Statistics of Local Robustness: Mean, minimum, expectation, and threshold-based statistics of local robustness radii across a dataset.\n    *   Benchmark Correctness:  Using performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) on a benchmark dataset with various perturbations.\n*   **Perturbation Metrics:**\n    *   Distance-based (Input Space): Primarily uses Lp-norms (L0, L1, L2, Linf) to measure the distance between images.\n    *   Semantic Feature-based:  Using parametric metrics of geometric transformations (rotation, scaling) or semantic changes (brightness, contrast) to measure perturbation.\n*   **Targeted Robustness:** Focuses on the resilience of a neural network to specific target labels or categories, rather than guaranteeing robustness against all other labels.\n\n**IV. Assessment Methods (Indicating Active Research Areas)**\n\n*   **Robustness Verification:**  Aims to determine if a network is robust within a specific perturbation range.\n    *   **Formal Verification:**\n        *   *Complete Methods:* Provide deterministic guarantees (exact solutions for robustness boundaries). SMT or MILP are used. Computationally expensive.\n        *   *Incomplete Methods:* Compute a lower bound as an approximation.  Includes convex relaxation, abstract interpretation, Lipschitz constant-based, randomized smoothing, interval bound propagation (IBP)-based, and cybernetics-based methods.\n    *   **Statistical Verification:**  Estimates the probability of inputs satisfying the robustness condition within a verification region. Addresses limitations of formal verification. Can be white-box (formal framework) or black-box (input layer sampling).\n*   **Robustness Testing:** Involves constructing test datasets with perturbations to evaluate the correctness of a model's output.\n    *   **Adversarial Testing:** Generates perturbed test cases using adversarial attack techniques. Estimates an upper bound of robustness.\n    *   **Benchmark Testing:**  Generates a benchmark dataset with various perturbation types and degrees.  Measures robustness by performance on the benchmark. Suitable for models with semantic features in their inputs.\n*   **Test Adequacy Analysis:**\n    *   Neuron Coverage: Measuring the activation of neurons in the network during testing. (Limited effectiveness in evaluating robustness).\n    *   Input Domain Coverage: Using geometric diversity to measure the feature diversity of perturbed inputs.\n\n**V. Challenges and Future Directions (Indicating Trends)**\n\n*   **Limitations of Current Metrics:**  Hypersphere modeling based on L\\_p norms may be insufficient for representing complex data corruptions, especially correlated pixel changes in images.  There is a push toward more realistic perturbation models.\n*   **Need for Standardized Benchmarks:**  Developing standardized testing procedures and effective benchmarks is crucial.  These benchmarks need to be representative, repeatable, and comprehensive.\n*   **Integration of Assessment Approaches:** Combining formal verification, adversarial testing, and benchmark methods for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n*   **Global Robustness Estimation:** Develop new methods to analyze robustness from local to global.\n*   **Robustness Evaluation of Large-Scale Neural Networks:** Addressing the lack of effective methods for assessing the robustness of large models. This suggests research is moving towards the evaluation of larger, more practical models.\n\n**VI.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Models for Image Classification (Assuming from the content)\n\n**Authors:** Chengbin Du, Yanxi Li, Chang Xu\n\n**Key Focus of the Paper:** Investigating the adversarial robustness of Visual State Space Model (VMamba) for image classification. The paper compares VMamba's robustness against Transformer architectures (specifically Swin Transformer, DeiT, and ViT) under various adversarial attacks and perturbations.\n\n**Publication Date:**  (Not Explicitly Provided, but inferred to be within the last 2 years based on the prompt and mention of recent models).\n\n**Summary of Findings on Adversarial Robustness Trends (Based on VMamba Analysis):**\n\nThe paper focuses on analyzing the adversarial robustness of VMamba, and in doing so, it touches on several trends in the field by comparing VMamba to existing models:\n\n1.  **VMamba vs. Transformers:** The paper highlights a trend of exploring alternative architectures to Transformers, such as Visual State Space Models (SSMs), for improved efficiency and robustness.\n    *   The paper positions VMamba as a potential alternative to Transformers for image classification, emphasizing its linear complexity and global receptive fields.\n    *   The paper finds that **VMamba exhibits better adversarial robustness than Transformer architectures (specifically, Swin Transformer) under white-box attacks like FGSM and PGD.** VMamba achieves higher accuracy under these attacks compared to Swin.\n    *   However, the paper also points out that **VMamba's scalability proves relatively weak against adversarial attacks.** The performance gap between VMamba and Transformers narrows as the model size increases.\n    *   In the context of *black-box attacks and transferability*, adversarial samples generated by Swin models were highly effective at attacking VMamba models, suggesting that the two architectures have similar methods of feature extraction.\n\n2.  **Patch-wise Robustness:**\n    *   VMamba exhibits superior robustness against patch-wise white-box adversarial attacks compared to Swin models. However, the robustness of VMamba is dependent on the number of disturbed patches.  The more patches that are affected, the more vulnerable VMamba becomes due to error accumulation along its scanning trajectory.\n    *   The paper also discusses the difference between dense perturbation (patch-wise drop) and sparse perturbation (pixel-wise drop). VMamba is more robust to pixel-wise perturbations than patch-wise drops, suggesting VMamba has a broader receptive field than Swin models.\n\n3.  **General Robustness (Out-of-Distribution and Common Corruptions):**\n    *   **VMamba exhibits superior generalizability when faced with out-of-distribution data (ImageNet-R).** VMamba models consistently outperform state-of-the-art Transformer-based models on ImageNet-R.\n    *   However, **VMamba's scalability proves relatively weak against natural adversarial examples (ImageNet-A) and common corruptions (ImageNet-C).**  Larger VMamba models do not consistently show improved performance on these datasets compared to smaller variants or Transformer-based models.\n\n4.  **Gradient Analysis & Parameter Sensitivity:**\n    *   The paper delves into *why* VMamba is robust to white-box attacks by examining the influence of individual parameters (A, B, C, \u0394) on robustness.\n    *   The gradients of parameter A are hard to estimate by the attack algorithm, potentially stabilizing the model.\n    *   Gradients of parameters B and C primarily contribute to VMamba vulnerability, which increases with model size.\n    *   Parameter \u0394 demonstrates defensive capabilities against white-box attacks, with its effectiveness growing with model size.\n    *   The trade-off between parameters B, C, and \u0394 leads to the robustness of the VMamba model not increasing proportionally with model size.\n\n5.  **Sensitivity to Spatial Information:**\n    *   VMamba is highly sensitive to the spatial information of images (relative positions of patches).\n    *   The closer the perturbation is to the center of the image, the more vulnerable VMamba will be.\n\n**Key Takeaways & Trends Implied:**\n\n*   **SSMs as a Promising Direction:** The paper suggests that Visual State Space Models like VMamba are a promising area of research for image classification, offering potential advantages in efficiency and robustness compared to Transformers.\n*   **Importance of Scalability:** The paper highlights the importance of addressing scalability issues in new architectures.  While VMamba shows promise, its weak scalability against adversarial attacks and general robustness benchmarks needs to be addressed.\n*   **Vulnerability to Specific Perturbations:** The paper emphasizes that models can be vulnerable to specific types of perturbations (e.g., patch-wise drops for VMamba), indicating a need for more comprehensive robustness evaluations.\n*   **Understanding Model Internals:**  The analysis of VMamba's gradients provides insights into *why* certain parameters contribute to vulnerability or defense, emphasizing the importance of understanding model internals for improving robustness.\n*   **The trend of exploring new architectural components** that enhance robustness but might introduce unique sensitivities (e.g., the scanning trajectory in VMamba).\n\n**Suggested Improvements:**\n\n*   Address the vulnerabilities of parameters B and C by using regularization techniques to prevent them from becoming focal points of attack.\n*   Amplify the defensive capabilities inherent to the \u0394 parameter, perhaps through targeted training approaches or architectural modifications.\n*   Investigate alternative scanning strategies that can effectively understand and leverage the complex contextual relationships among patches in an image.\n*   Develop adaptive scanning strategies that allow the model to dynamically adjust its scanning path in response to detected patch drops.\n*   Develop robust feature extraction techniques that tolerate minor errors.\n\n**Appendix Information (Vim):**\n\n*   The paper includes supplementary material comparing Vim (another visual SSM) to Transformer models. Vim demonstrates superior adversarial robustness compared to DeiT and ViT. Vim shows remarkable robustness against common corruptions but is weaker against natural adversarial examples and out-of-distribution data.\n\n**Overall, the paper contributes to the trend of exploring and evaluating novel architectures beyond Transformers for image classification, with a particular focus on adversarial robustness. It identifies both strengths and weaknesses of VMamba, providing valuable insights for future research directions in this area.**"

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed breakdown of the relevant information from the paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Information Summary**\n\n*   **Title:** On the Robustness of Large Multimodal Models Against Image Adversarial Attacks\n*   **Year:**  The paper uses recent models and cites recent works, strongly implying it falls within the last two years.\n*   **Focus:** The paper investigates the robustness of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) against visual adversarial attacks. While the study touches on image classification, it also extends to image captioning and Visual Question Answering (VQA).\n*   **Key Finding:** LMMs are generally vulnerable to visual adversarial perturbations, even if the perturbations are generated only with respect to the visual model. However, the context provided significantly impacts robustness.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question**\n\nThis paper is *highly relevant* because it directly addresses adversarial robustness, specifically in the context of image-related tasks, using recent LMM architectures. It provides insights into the latest trends by:\n\n1.  **Examining State-of-the-Art Models:** The study evaluates the adversarial robustness of recent and popular LMMs like LLaVA1.5, BLIP2, and InstructBLIP. These models represent the current state-of-the-art in multimodal learning.\n2.  **Focusing on Visual Adversarial Attacks:** The paper investigates how adversarial perturbations in the *visual* modality impact the performance of LMMs. This is a critical aspect of robustness in multimodal systems.\n3.  **Analyzing Different Attack Strategies:** The research employs various gradient-based white-box attacks, including PGD, APGD, and CW, with varying degrees of attack strength. This provides a comprehensive analysis of the models' vulnerability.\n4.  **Highlighting the Role of Context:** The research reveals that the robustness of LMMs is significantly influenced by the context provided to the model. This is a crucial finding, indicating that LMMs are more resilient when additional textual information is available.\n\n**Detailed Extraction of Relevant Information**\n\n*   **Vulnerability to Visual Adversarial Perturbations:**\n\n    *   LMMs are generally vulnerable even when the adversarial perturbations are generated only with respect to the visual model. This suggests that attacks don't need to be end-to-end on the entire LMM to be effective.\n    *   This vulnerability is especially pronounced in tasks like image classification without context or image captioning, where no additional textual information is provided.\n    *   In caption retrieval tasks, significant decreases in post-attack accuracy were observed across all three LMMs (LLaVA, BLIP2-T5, InstructBLIP) under both normal and strong PGD and APGD attacks, suggesting that the LLM component of the model does not provide any extra protection against visual adversarial attacks.\n\n*   **Impact of Context on Robustness:**\n\n    *   The presence of context seems to bolster LMM robustness, as seen in tasks like COCO classification with context and VQA. In cases where the attack does not directly target the core aspects of the task, such as in VQA, LMMs display a degree of inherent robustness.\n    *   Adding textual context notably improves LMMs\u2019 robustness against visual adversarial input.\n    *   The paper experimentally demonstrates that if the query's focus differs from the target of the attack, the LMMs are capable of delivering correct responses.\n\n*   **Attack Methods Used:**\n\n    *   The study focuses on gradient-based white-box adversarial attacks (PGD, CW, APGD).\n    *   Attacks are generated solely with respect to the image encoder of the LMM (CLIP or EVA-CLIP).\n    *   Two parameter settings are used for each attack: normal and strong, to vary the perceptibility of the perturbations.\n\n*   **Models Evaluated:**\n\n    *   LLaVA1.5 (with Vicuna13B)\n    *   BLIP2 (with Flan T5 XXL)\n    *   InstructBLIP (with Vicuna13b)\n\n*   **Tasks Used for Evaluation:**\n\n    *   Image classification (COCO, ImageNet)\n    *   Caption retrieval (COCO)\n    *   VQA (VQA V2, ScienceQA, TextVQA, POPE, MME)\n\n*   **Query Decomposition:**\n\n    *   The paper proposes a new approach to real-world image classification called query decomposition, where each question is decomposed into multiple existence questions, each querying the presence of one object class, along with the context corresponding to that object.\n    *   By incorporating existence queries into the input prompt, the researchers observe diminished attack effectiveness and improvements in image classification accuracy.\n\n**Specific Experimental Results Relevant to Image Classification Robustness:**\n\n*   **Table 4:**  Shows that adding a short sentence of context improves post-attack accuracy for image classification.  For instance, the accuracy drop for BLIP2/InstructBLIP under PGD/APGD reduces to only around 20% with added context.\n*   **Table 5:** Highlights the impact of \"Query Decomposition\" on image classification robustness. In the experiment with COCO, the drops were around 10% smaller, and 20% smaller for Imagenet, comparing to post-attack accuracy drops without context\n*   The results are for COCO 2014val and Imagenet 2012val datasets.\n\n**Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Inferred from the Paper)**\n\nBased on the paper's findings, the following trends can be identified:\n\n*   **Focus on Multimodal Models:** There's a growing interest in evaluating the robustness of LMMs, which are becoming increasingly prevalent.\n*   **Context-Aware Robustness:** Robustness is not just about the model architecture, but also about how the model is used. Contextual information plays a crucial role in mitigating adversarial effects.\n*   **Visual Attacks are Still a Threat:** Despite the sophistication of LMMs, they remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, indicating the need for more robust visual encoders.\n*   **Importance of Task-Specific Evaluation:**  Adversarial robustness needs to be evaluated in the context of specific tasks.  An attack that works well for captioning might not be as effective for VQA.\n*   **Exploration of Prompt Engineering for Robustness:** Techniques like query decomposition are being explored to improve robustness through careful design of prompts and queries.\n\n**Limitations of the Paper (with respect to the research question):**\n\n*   **Limited Scope on Defenses:**  The paper primarily focuses on *evaluating* robustness rather than *developing* new defense mechanisms.\n*   **White-Box Attacks:**  The study mainly uses white-box attacks, which may not fully reflect real-world scenarios where attackers have limited access to model internals.\n\nIn summary, this paper is very relevant to the research question. It identifies key trends in the adversarial robustness of image classification, specifically highlighting the vulnerability of large multimodal models and the importance of context. The techniques are state-of-the-art and the timeframe is appropriate."

It focuses on selecting clean samples with adversarial robustness (SCAR) to improve the performance of SSL algorithms, which is directly relevant to the research question",
      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed extraction and analysis:\n\n**1. Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on improving semi-supervised learning (SSL) for image classification using adversarial attacks.  It *does not* directly focus on improving adversarial robustness itself. Instead, it *leverages* adversarial attacks as a tool to improve SSL performance. The core idea is to use adversarial attacks to select \"clean\" (reliable) unlabeled samples for pseudo-labeling, which is a common technique in SSL.\n\n**2. Relevant Techniques and Algorithms (with dates):**\n\n*   **SCAR (Selecting Clean samples with Adversarial Robustness):** This is the *proposed* framework. It uses adversarial attacks to identify reliable unlabeled data points to augment the labeled dataset during semi-supervised training. It uses the robustness to adversarial attacks as a proxy for the \"cleanliness\" or reliability of the unlabeled data.\n*   **Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) [7] (2017):** Used as a baseline SSL algorithm. VAT adds adversarial perturbations to images and enforces consistency between the predictions of the original and perturbed images. VAT is used a pre-training method, before applying the SCAR framework.\n*   **MixMatch [2] (2019):** Another baseline SSL algorithm used for pre-training. MixMatch combines entropy minimization, consistency regularization, and MixUp to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data.\n*   **FixMatch [8] (2020):** A third baseline SSL algorithm used for pre-training. FixMatch builds upon MixMatch by only using high-confidence pseudo-labels for unlabeled data to mitigate the risk of incorporating incorrect labels.\n*   **FlexMatch [12] (2021):** A variant of FixMatch that uses flexible thresholds for selecting high-confident data.\n*   **UDA (Unsupervised Domain Adaptation) [10] (2020):** Consistency training by using unsupervised data augmentation.\n*   **ReMixMatch [1] (2019):** An extension of MixMatch that applies distribution aligning and augmentation anchoring.\n*   **PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) [6] (2018):** Used as an adversarial attack method for finding adversarial examples.\n\n**3. Key Ideas and How They Relate to Adversarial Robustness (Indirectly):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Attacks for Sample Selection:** The paper's core contribution is using adversarial attacks *not* to make the model robust but to *select better training data*. The assumption is that if an unlabeled data point's predicted class remains the same even after an adversarial perturbation, it's a more reliable data point to use for pseudo-labeling.\n*   **Sensitivity and Specificity Metrics:** The paper introduces sensitivity (rate of correct pseudo-labeling) and specificity (rate of incorrect pseudo-labeling) to evaluate the clean sample selection process. It analyzes how the perturbation size (epsilon) in the adversarial attack affects these metrics.\n*   **Trade-off in Perturbation Size:** The paper notes that a larger perturbation size (epsilon) in the adversarial attack leads to higher sensitivity (more correctly labeled samples are selected) but lower specificity (more incorrectly labeled samples are also selected). This highlights the importance of finding the right balance.\n\n**4. Experimental Results:**\n\n*   SCAR improves the performance of VAT, MixMatch, and FixMatch on CIFAR10. This suggests that using adversarial attacks for sample selection can be an effective strategy for semi-supervised learning.\n\n**5. Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n*   The study is limited to CIFAR10.\n*   The SCAR framework is a two-step process (pre-training followed by SCAR). The authors suggest that an end-to-end learning procedure would be more desirable.\n\n**Answer to the Research Question:**\n\nBased on this paper (and keeping in mind its limitations):\n\nThe paper suggests that adversarial robustness is *related* to trends in image classification in the following way:\n\n*   **Adversarial attacks are being used as a tool to improve semi-supervised learning performance, not necessarily to improve adversarial robustness directly.** This represents a trend of *leveraging* adversarial techniques for other machine learning tasks. The core idea is that data points that are \"robust\" to adversarial perturbations (i.e., their predicted labels don't change easily) are more likely to be reliable and useful for training.\n\nHowever, the paper does not directly present latest trends in adversarial robustness.\n\n**Important Caveats:**\n\n*   This paper is primarily about *semi-supervised learning*. Its relevance to *adversarial robustness* is indirect.\n*   The paper focuses on a specific technique (SCAR) and a limited set of datasets (CIFAR10).  It's difficult to generalize these findings to all areas of adversarial robustness.\n*   The references cited are from 2021 and earlier, so the listed methods are not the *newest* (as of late 2024)."

Relevance Assessment**\n\n*   **Focus:** The paper primarily focuses on adversarial robustness in *radio signal classification*, not image classification. However, it references and compares its findings to existing research on *image classification* regarding adversarial robustness. Thus, the references could have the trends in the last two years.\n\n*   **Date:** The paper itself doesn't have a clear submission or publication date within the markdown content. However, given the context of \"latest trends,\" we'll focus on extracting information from references within the last two years (approximately 2022-2024).\n\n**II. Extracted Information (Focusing on Image Classification References related to Adversarial Robustness and QML, published since 2022):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant parts, including insights gleaned from the paper's discussion of existing literature:\n\n1.  **Quantum Machine Learning (QML) & Adversarial Robustness in Image Classification:**\n\n    *   The paper highlights a trend of using Quantum Variational Classifiers (QVCs) for enhanced robustness against classical adversarial attacks in *image classification*.  The key idea is that QVCs can learn features that classical neural networks don't detect, making them more resilient.\n\n    *   **[10]** West et al., *Nature Machine Intelligence, 5(6):581\u2013589, May 2023.*  This paper suggests the area of research of enhanced adversarial robustness in machine learning *Towards quantum enhanced adversarial robustness in machine learning*.\n\n    *   **[9]** West et al., *Phys. Rev. Res., 5:023186, Jun 2023.* This paper indicates the need for a  Benchmarking adversarially robust quantum machine learning at scale.\n\n    *   **Key Finding:** QVCs show remarkable resilience to adversarial attacks generated on classical neural networks for image classification, particularly in a *black-box* setting (where the attacker has limited knowledge of the QVC model).\n\n    *   **Transferability:** Adversarial examples crafted through *white-box* attacks (attacker knows the model) *on the QVCs* tend to transfer well to classical models (meaning they can fool classical models). This suggests a potential weakness \u2013 if an attacker *can* understand the QVC, they can create attacks that break classical models.\n\n2.  **Adversarial Training in Quantum Machine Learning:**\n\n    *   **[24]** Ren et al., *Nature Computational Science, 2(11):711\u2013717, Nov 2022.* Addresses the impact of noise on quantum hardware and adversarial attacks in QVCs.\n    *   **Key finding:** Ren et al.'s work found that QVCs trained on real quantum hardware can be fooled, demonstrating the real negative effects of adversarial attacks on current noisy hardware. However, incorporating an adversarial training process significantly increases their resilience to these perturbations.\n\n3.  **Limitations and Open Questions (Indicating Areas of Active Research):**\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes that Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning (QAML) is still in its early stages.\n    *   Many important issues remain largely unexplored.\n    *   Most research focuses on computer vision for image classification, leaving other domains (like radio signals) less investigated.\n\n**III. Summarized Trends**\n\nBased on the extracted information, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (in the context of QML) appear to be:\n\n1.  **Quantum Variational Classifiers (QVCs) as a Defense:**  Using QVCs to create image classifiers that are inherently more robust against adversarial attacks, especially black-box attacks. The robustness comes from the QVC learning different features than classical NNs.\n2.  **Adversarial Training for QML:**  Acknowledging the vulnerability of QVCs (especially on noisy quantum hardware) and using adversarial training techniques to improve their robustness.\n3.  **Transferability Exploits:** Understanding how adversarial examples transfer between QVCs and classical models to identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors (e.g., attacking a QVC to generate attacks that break classical models).\n4.  **Addressing Noise in Quantum Hardware:** Developing techniques (likely including noise-aware training) to make QML models more robust to adversarial attacks even when run on real, noisy quantum computers.\n5.   **Approximate Amplitude Encoding:** Implementation of approximate amplitude encoding technique on radio signal data\n\n**IV. Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Radio Signals vs. Images:** It's critical to remember that the core of *this* paper is radio signals. The trends identified above are primarily *derived* from references to image classification work *within the paper*.\n*   **Search Expansion:** To get a more complete picture, a focused literature search specifically on \"adversarial robustness image classification quantum machine learning\" in databases like arXiv, IEEE Xplore, or ACM Digital Library (filtering for 2022-2024) would be essential."

While it focuses on medical images, the techniques used are relevant to the broader research question of adversarial robustness in image classification and is within the last two years.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper \"SEDA: Self-Ensembling ViT with Defensive Distillation and Adversarial Training for robust Chest X-rays Classification\" concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on aspects within the last 2 years (since the paper was written in 2023).\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper**\n\nThe paper addresses the vulnerability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to adversarial attacks, particularly in the context of medical imaging (chest X-ray classification for Tuberculosis).  It proposes a method called SEDA (Self-Ensembling ViT with Defensive Distillation and Adversarial Training) to improve the adversarial robustness of ViTs while maintaining accuracy and improving computational efficiency.\n\n**Key Trends & Techniques (within the last 2 years / since 2022):**\n\nThe following trends are either discussed in the paper, or are part of the novelty of this paper, and are therefore implied as important trends.\n*   **Adversarial Training:**\n    *   SEDA explicitly leverages adversarial training. The model is trained on a combination of clean images *and* adversarially perturbed images. This forces the model to learn features that are more resistant to small, malicious input changes.  The results show a clear improvement in robust accuracy after adversarial training (Tables 1 and 2).\n    *   The paper mentions that adversarial training leads to better model generalizability and an improved ability to handle perturbations (Introduction section). The study shows that vulnerability to model extraction attacks is reduced after post-adversarial training.\n    *   The paper cites Madry et al. (2018) as a foundational work in adversarial training.\n*   **Defensive Distillation:**\n    *   SEDA uses defensive distillation, a technique where a \"student\" model is trained to mimic the softened output probabilities of a more robust \"teacher\" model. This is intended to make the student model less sensitive to adversarial perturbations.\n    *   The use of soft probabilities during distillation results in a smaller and more efficient model with faster inference time and reduced computational requirements. Moreover, the distilled model is more robust to adversarial attacks since the soft probabilities introduce uncertainty and variation in the output probabilities.\n    *   The paper cites Papernot et al. (2016) as a key reference for defensive distillation.\n*   **Ensembling of Vision Transformers:**\n    *   The paper builds upon the Self-Ensembling Vision Transformer (SEViT) architecture.  SEViT (Almalik et al., 2022 - cited in the paper) is itself a relatively recent approach. Ensembling involves combining the outputs of multiple classifiers within the ViT to make a final prediction. This increases robustness, as an attacker needs to fool *all* the classifiers, not just one.\n    *   SEViT adds an MLP classifier at the end of each block to leverage patch tokens and generate a probability distribution over class labels. This approach enables the self-ensembling of classifiers, which can be fused to obtain the final classification result.\n    *   SEDA improves upon SEViT by replacing the MLPs with more efficient CNN blocks and incorporating adversarial training and defensive distillation.\n    *   The core idea of ensembling (especially *self-ensembling* within a single model) is highlighted as a promising defense.\n*   **Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their vulnerabilities:**\n    *   The paper explicitly addresses the vulnerabilities of ViTs to adversarial attacks. This highlights a trend: as ViTs become more popular, understanding and mitigating their weaknesses becomes crucial.\n    *   The paper mentions that adversarial attacks can be more potent against ViTs by targeting both intermediate representations and the final class token.\n*   **Efficient Architectures and Computational Cost:**\n    *   SEDA focuses on improving the *efficiency* of adversarial defenses. The substitution of MLP blocks with CNN blocks is motivated by a desire to reduce computational overhead while maintaining or improving robustness.\n    *   The method aims to create solutions suitable for \"real-world deployment\".\n*   **Model Extraction Attacks:**\n    *   The paper acknowledges and addresses the threat of model extraction attacks, where an adversary tries to steal the model by querying it many times. Defensive distillation is used to make model extraction more difficult.\n    *   The study evaluates the performance of original and distilled models against extraction attacks in a black-box setting.\n*   **Medical Image Analysis Focus:**\n    *   While the *techniques* are general, the paper's focus on medical imaging highlights the importance of adversarial robustness in high-stakes applications where incorrect diagnoses due to adversarial attacks could have serious consequences.\n\n**Specific Contributions of SEDA (Related to Recent Trends):**\n\n*   **CNNs as Efficient MLP Alternatives:** The paper demonstrates that small CNN blocks can be a computationally efficient alternative to MLP blocks in self-ensembling ViTs, offering a good balance between accuracy, robustness, and computational cost. (This contributes to the trend of efficient architectures).\n*   **Combination of Techniques:** SEDA's novelty lies in the *combination* of self-ensembling, adversarial training, and defensive distillation in the context of ViTs. The results show that this combination leads to state-of-the-art robustness in the Tuberculosis x-ray classification task.\n*   **Practical Evaluation:** The paper emphasizes the evaluation of computational parameters (FLOPs, # of parameters) alongside accuracy metrics, reflecting a trend towards practical and deployable solutions.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work (Related to Future Trends):**\n\n*   The paper mentions exploring differential privacy as a future direction. This indicates a growing interest in combining adversarial robustness with privacy-preserving techniques.\n*   The paper also mentions exploring a diverse set of alternatives for each block rather than just having CNN for every block, indicating that creating diversity among the ensemble models would improve the overall performance.\n\nIn summary, this paper contributes to several recent trends in adversarial robustness: (1) developing defenses specifically for Vision Transformers, (2) using adversarial training and defensive distillation (often in combination), (3) focusing on efficient and deployable solutions, (4) addressing model extraction attacks, and (5) recognizing the importance of robustness in high-stakes applications like medical imaging."

      "summary": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided paper to extract information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overview of the Paper and its Relevance**\n\nThis paper focuses on adversarial robustness, specifically in the context of Stacked Capsule Autoencoders (SCAEs), a type of neural network for image classification. The paper discusses an evasion attack against SCAEs and proposes a defense method called Hybrid Adversarial Training (HAT).  While the paper primarily focuses on SCAEs, it touches upon broader trends in adversarial robustness by referencing and building upon existing techniques like adversarial training and distillation.  The paper itself appears to be relatively recent, which makes it relevant to the prompt, even though it focuses on a specific network architecture.  The publication date isn't explicitly stated in the provided markdown, but references up to 2021 suggests currency.\n\n**Extracted Information Addressing the Research Question**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the information extracted, organized to highlight the trends and techniques discussed:\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training:**\n\n    *   **Description:** The paper heavily utilizes adversarial training as a core component of its defense method. Adversarial training involves augmenting the training dataset with adversarial examples (perturbed inputs designed to fool the model).  The model is then trained to correctly classify these adversarial examples, increasing its robustness.\n\n    *   **Relevance to Trends:** Adversarial training has been a prominent trend in adversarial robustness research for several years, and the paper reinforces its continued importance. The paper highlights that effective adversarial training requires a balance between improving robustness and minimizing the impact on accuracy on clean samples. The paper cites several studies that do adversarial training [25,26,40\u201344].\n    *   **Specific Implementation (AT-SCAE):**  The authors propose AT-SCAE (Adversarial Training SCAE) in which adversarial examples are generated and added to the training dataset. A modified reconstruction loss function is used. If the input is an adversarial sample, the reconstruction loss is computed as the distance between the decoded image and the corresponding clean sample. This forces the SCAE to discard adversarial features and focus on clean features. Adversarial training is conducted at intervals to mitigate impacts on accuracy.\n\n2.  **Adversarial Distillation:**\n\n    *   **Description:**  Adversarial distillation is another technique employed in the paper. Distillation involves training a smaller \"student\" model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex \"teacher\" model. In adversarial distillation, the teacher model is often trained to be robust against adversarial examples, and this robustness is then transferred to the student model.\n\n    *   **Relevance to Trends:**  Distillation has gained traction as a way to improve the efficiency and robustness of models. Adversarial distillation specifically addresses robustness by transferring knowledge from a robust teacher to a student.\n    *   **Specific Implementation (AD-SCAE):** The authors propose AD-SCAE (Adversarial Distillation SCAE) to improve accuracy while maintaining robustness. A teacher model is trained normally, and a student model is trained using adversarial distillation. The loss function is modified to include the distance between the teacher's output on the original sample and the student's output on the adversarial sample. This guides the student model to correctly identify adversarial sample characteristics.\n\n3.  **Hybrid Approaches (HAT):**\n\n    *   **Description:**  The paper's primary contribution is a \"Hybrid Adversarial Training\" (HAT) method. HAT combines adversarial training and adversarial distillation.\n\n    *   **Relevance to Trends:** Combining multiple defense techniques is a growing trend in adversarial robustness research.  Individual defenses often have limitations, and combining them can lead to more effective protection.\n    *   **Specific Implementation (HAT-SCAE):** The authors propose HAT-SCAE (Hybrid Adversarial Training SCAE). The method first trains the SCAE model using adversarial distillation. Then, after the model has enough accuracy, adversarial training is used to enhance robustness and fix vulnerabilities inherited from the teacher model. This sequential approach leverages the benefits of both techniques.\n\n4.  **Capsule Networks and Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n    *   **Description:** The paper focuses on the adversarial robustness of Capsule Networks (CapsNets), specifically SCAEs. CapsNets are designed to be more robust to affine transformations than traditional CNNs, but have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The paper argues that existing defenses for CapsNets primarily focus on dynamic routing capsule networks and that SCAEs have been relatively unexplored.\n    *   **Relevance to Trends:** The paper suggests the trend of studying the adversarial vulnerability and defense of novel neural network architectures (e.g., CapsNets). Furthermore, the paper mentions that there are studies aiming at improving the resistance of CapsNets to adversarial attacks [7\u20139].\n\n5.  **Evasion Attacks:**\n\n    *   **Description:** The paper discusses evasion attacks, which occur at testing time, applying imperceptible perturbations to clean samples to cause misclassification. The authors craft an evasion attack against SCAEs.\n    *   **Relevance to Trends:** Evasion attacks are a common threat model in adversarial robustness, and defenses against these attacks are important to study.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations**\n\n*   **Specificity to SCAEs:**  The paper's primary focus is on a specific network architecture (SCAEs).  While the techniques used (adversarial training, distillation) are general, the results and conclusions are most directly applicable to SCAEs.\n*   **Limited Scope of References:** The paper is not a comprehensive survey of all adversarial robustness techniques. It focuses on the techniques relevant to its proposed defense method.\n*   **Lack of Explicit Dates:** The markdown doesn't explicitly state the publication date of the paper. However, the reference dates and the content suggest it falls within the last 2 years.\n\n**Summary of Trends Based on the Paper**\n\nBased on the information extracted from the paper, the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification can be identified:\n\n*   **Continued Importance of Adversarial Training:** Adversarial training remains a fundamental technique for improving robustness.\n*   **Use of Distillation for Robustness and Efficiency:** Adversarial distillation is being used to transfer robustness from teacher models to student models, potentially improving efficiency and generalization.\n*   **Hybrid Defense Strategies:** Combining multiple defense techniques, such as adversarial training and distillation, is a promising approach.\n*   **Focus on Novel Architectures:** There's ongoing research into the adversarial vulnerability and defense of new network architectures like Capsule Networks.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper highlights the relevance of adversarial training, distillation, and hybrid defenses for image classification, while also focusing on a relatively underexplored network architecture."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on adversarial robustness in image classification, specifically within the last two years, as of the paper's publication date (which we assume to be in 2023, based on the references):\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper presents \"RoS-KD,\" a Robust Stochastic Knowledge Distillation framework.  It's designed to improve the performance and robustness of deep learning models, particularly in the context of noisy medical imaging datasets. A key aspect is improving robustness against *adversarial attacks*.\n\n**Key Information Related to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   **RoS-KD's Robustness to Adversarial Attacks:** The paper explicitly states and experimentally verifies that RoS-KD produces student models that are more robust to adversarial attacks compared to baseline methods.\n*   **Adversarial Attack Experiments:** The researchers conducted experiments to evaluate RoS-KD's robustness against adversarial attacks.\n*   **Specific Attacks Used:** The paper mentions using two representative adversarial attacks:\n    *   **FSGM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)** \\[25]\n    *   **PGD (Projected Gradient Descent)** \\[26]\n*   **Performance Metric:** Robustness is measured by comparing the *precision, recall, and F1-score* of models *before and after* the adversarial attacks.\n*   **Results:** RoS-KD consistently shows higher precision, recall, and F1-scores *after* the attacks compared to the Baseline III (a multi-teacher ensemble model with equal weights).\n    * On the lesion classification task, RoS-KD has +4.5% and +6.3% higher robustness than Baseline III on FSGM and PGD attacks, respectively.\n    * On the cardiopulmonary disease classification task, RoS-KD has +4.3% and +4.2% higher robustness than Baseline III under FSGM and PGD attacks, respectively.\n*   **Table II:** Table II in the paper presents a detailed performance comparison of RoS-KD versus Baseline III under the FSGM and PGD attacks, showing the precision, recall, and F1-scores before and after the attacks for both lesion classification and cardiopulmonary disease classification tasks.\n*   **Medical Imaging Focus:** The study focuses on adversarial robustness within the medical imaging domain, which is a high-stakes area where the reliability of AI is critical.\n*   **Smooth Loss Landscape:** The paper also suggests that RoS-KD students exhibit a highly smooth loss landscape, potentially contributing to better generalization and, indirectly, robustness.  This is visually represented in Figure 4, which compares the loss landscape of RoS-KD to a baseline model.\n\n**How RoS-KD Achieves Adversarial Robustness (Potential Mechanisms):**\n\nWhile the paper doesn't explicitly isolate *why* RoS-KD is more robust, several elements likely contribute:\n\n*   **Knowledge Distillation from Multiple Teachers:** The core idea is that learning from multiple \"noisy\" teachers, and dynamically weighting their influence, makes the student less susceptible to the specific vulnerabilities that a single, potentially flawed, model might have.\n*   **Overlapping Subsets of Training Data:**  Training teachers on overlapping subsets of data encourages them to learn common, robust features, while the unique subsets allow them to learn diverse representations and avoid converging on the same noise patterns.\n*   **Stochastic Weighting:** The stochastic assignment of weights to teachers during distillation introduces further regularization and prevents the student from overly relying on any single teacher, which could be vulnerable to specific attacks.\n*   **Smooth Parameter Averaging:** This technique aims to find flatter minima in the loss landscape, which are generally associated with better generalization and robustness.  The smoother loss landscape suggests that the model is less sensitive to small perturbations in the input.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Specific Datasets:** The results are specific to the two medical imaging datasets used (lesion classification and cardiopulmonary disease classification).  Robustness might vary on other datasets.\n*   **Attack Types:** The study only evaluates against FSGM and PGD.  Other, potentially more sophisticated, attacks might reveal different vulnerabilities.\n*   **White-Box Setting:**  The attacks used (FSGM and PGD) are generally considered \"white-box\" attacks, meaning the attacker has full knowledge of the model.  Robustness in black-box settings (where the attacker has limited knowledge) might be different.\n\n**Summary Table from the Paper (Table II):**\n\n| Dataset             | Attack | Settings    | Before Attack (Precision) | Before Attack (Recall) | Before Attack (F1) | After Attack (Precision) | After Attack (Recall) | After Attack (F1) |\n| ------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- |\n| Lesion              | PGD    | Baseline III | 0.691                     | 0.704                    | 0.694                | 0.363                     | 0.293                   | 0.309               |\n| Lesion              | PGD    | RoS-KD      | 0.713                     | 0.726                    | 0.716                | **0.417**                 | **0.359**               | **0.354**           |\n| Lesion              | FSGM   | Baseline III | 0.691                     | 0.704                    | 0.694                | 0.445                     | 0.377                   | 0.385               |\n| Lesion              | FSGM   | RoS-KD      | 0.713                     | 0.726                    | 0.716                | **0.475**                 | **0.422**               | **0.447**           |\n| Cardio.            | PGD    | Baseline III | 0.312                     | 0.348                    | 0.329                | 0.150                     | 0.131                   | 0.139               |\n| Cardio.            | PGD    | RoS-KD      | 0.360                     | 0.339                    | 0.349                | **0.189**                 | **0.175**               | **0.182**           |\n| Cardio.            | FSGM   | Baseline III | 0.312                     | 0.348                    | 0.329                | 0.162                     | 0.144                   | 0.152               |\n| Cardio.            | FSGM   | RoS-KD      | 0.360                     | 0.339                    | 0.349                | **0.201**                 | **0.187**               | **0.194**           |\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nThe paper contributes to the trend of improving adversarial robustness, specifically in medical image classification, through a knowledge distillation framework.

They compare the performance of models trained with and without SD-Dropout under adversarial attacks.\n    *   They use the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) as the adversarial attack method.\n\n4.  **Results Demonstrating Improved Robustness:**\n\n    *   Table 5 shows the accuracy of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and Stanford Dogs datasets under adversarial attack, with and without SD-Dropout.  In all cases, SD-Dropout significantly improves the accuracy under attack.  For example, on CIFAR-100, the accuracy improves from 37.9% (Base) to 47.1% (+SD-Dropout).\n    *   Figure 3 illustrates the adversarial robustness with collaborate cases, showing increased robustness with SD-Dropout. The text states, \"All results show increases in the robustness of the adversarial attacks. It can be concluded that the SD-Dropout method has an effect similar to that of adversarial training.\"\n\n5.  **Connection to Regularization:**\n\n    *   The paper frames SD-Dropout as a regularization technique.  This suggests a trend of viewing adversarial robustness as a property that can be improved through better regularization of the model.\n    *   \"From the perspective of the regularization domain, our method is superior to the conventional label smoothing method through multiple datasets. Thus, we expect our method to be used as a regularization method that can effectively improve the performance of a single network in various domains.\"\n\n**Implications for Trends in Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   **Self-Knowledge Distillation:**  This paper suggests that self-knowledge distillation is a promising approach for improving adversarial robustness.  Distilling knowledge within the model itself, without relying on external teacher networks, can lead to more robust representations.\n*   **Dropout as a Tool for Robustness:**  The use of Dropout in SD-Dropout is noteworthy.  Dropout is traditionally used for regularization and preventing overfitting, but this work shows that it can also be leveraged to improve robustness against adversarial examples. This may indicate a trend in re-evaluating the role of Dropout in adversarial settings.\n*   **Importance of Regularization:**  The paper reinforces the idea that adversarial robustness can be seen as a form of generalization, and therefore, techniques that improve generalization through regularization can also enhance robustness.\n*    **KL-Divergence Usage:**  The usage of both forward and reverse KL-divergence hints at a trend in carefully crafting loss functions for robustness. The analysis in section 3.3 and the empirical validation in section 4.6.1 suggest that paying attention to the gradient flow in KL-divergence can be beneficial.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on a specific technique (SD-Dropout). It doesn't provide a broad survey of all recent trends in adversarial robustness.\n*   The experiments are limited to a few datasets and attack methods."

It addresses real-world scenarios and proposes a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks. Published within the last two years.",
      "summary": "The paper \"Robust Real-World Image Super-Resolution against Adversarial Attacks\" published in MM '21 (October 2021) explores adversarial robustness in the context of image super-resolution (SR). While the paper's primary focus is on super-resolution rather than general image classification, it touches upon relevant trends in adversarial robustness that can be extrapolated to the broader image classification domain.  Given the research question about the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, with a focus on papers from the last 2 years, here's a detailed extraction and analysis of the relevant information from this paper:\n\n**I. Core Idea and Approach**\n\n*   **Frequency Domain Analysis:** The paper's central premise is that adversarial attacks introduce high-frequency noise into images. By analyzing the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of image features, the authors observe that adversarial examples exhibit significantly larger high-frequency components compared to clean images. This motivates the development of a defense mechanism that operates in the frequency domain. This highlights a trend: Analyzing and mitigating adversarial perturbations in the *frequency domain* is a promising direction.\n\n*   **Random Frequency Masking:** The core defense mechanism is a \"random frequency mask module.\" This module attempts to remove adversarial noise by selectively zeroing out high-frequency components in the DCT representation of images or feature maps. It does this stochastically, using a Bernoulli distribution to determine whether to mask a particular frequency component. This method of introducing randomness to the mask module can be seen as a trend to *randomize the defense mechanism* to make it harder for attackers to adapt.\n\n*   **Adversarial Sample Classifier:** To avoid removing important high-frequency details (e.g., textures) from clean images, the authors introduce an adversarial sample classifier. This classifier, trained on DCT maps, predicts whether an input image is adversarial. The frequency mask module is bypassed for images classified as clean, preserving their sharpness and fidelity. This introduces a trend to *selectively apply defense mechanisms based on whether the input is adversarial*.\n\n**II. Methodology**\n\n*   **DCT and Masking:** The method involves transforming an image/feature map into the DCT domain, applying a binary mask M to zero-out or attenuate high-frequency components (\ud835\udc4b[\u02c6]\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc4b[\u02c6] \u2299M), and then transforming back using inverse DCT.\n\n*   **Stochastic Mask Generation:** The binary mask M is created based on the normalized distance of each frequency component from the lowest-frequency component.  Coefficients with a distance smaller than a threshold (\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61) are kept (M(\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63) = 1). Coefficients with a distance larger than the threshold are subjected to a Bernoulli distribution to determine if they are masked (M(\ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc62,\ud835\udc63) )). This highlights the move towards *probabilistic defenses.*\n\n*   **Adversarial Classifier Architecture:**  The adversarial classifier takes a single-channel DCT map (averaged across channels) as input. This map is processed by average pooling, flattened into a vector, and fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier with LeakyReLU activations and a final Softmax layer for binary classification (adversarial or clean).  The use of DCT maps as input to a classifier is a key aspect of this defense.\n\n*   **Integration into SR Network:** The frequency mask modules are incorporated into an existing super-resolution (SR) network (specifically, the CDC network).  One mask module is placed at the head of the network, and another at the head and tail of each hourglass module, after initial training on non-robust networks.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:**  The overall network is trained using a stagewise adversarial training strategy:\n    1.  Train a basic SR network.\n    2.  Train the adversarial classifier on adversarial examples generated from the basic SR network.\n    3.  Train the complete SR network (with mask modules and the classifier) using adversarial training, where adversarial examples are generated by maximizing the SR loss functions. The adversarial classifier itself *is not* attacked during this process.  This reinforces the importance of adversarial training as a method to improve robustness.\n\n**III. Experiments and Results**\n\n*   **Dataset:**  RealSR dataset which uses real images to train networks\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:**  PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) are used to evaluate performance. Critically, PSNR and SSIM are computed between the super-resolved output of the *adversarial* image and the *original high-resolution ground truth*.\n*   **Baselines:**  The proposed method is compared against several existing SR models, including SRResNet, EDSR, RRDB, RCAN, CARN, LP-KPN, and CDC.\n*   **Attack:** White-box attacks are considered, where the attacker has full knowledge of the target model's parameters.  The basic attack from Choi et al. [10] (based on Iterative FGSM) is used.\n*   **Quantitative Results:** The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly better PSNR and SSIM scores than existing SR models under adversarial attack, while maintaining competitive performance on clean images.\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Ablation studies are performed to assess the effectiveness of the individual components: the random frequency mask module, the adversarial sample classifier, and adversarial training.\n*   **Comparison to Existing Defenses:** The proposed method is compared with other defense techniques, including JPEG compression, random resizing, high-frequency component suppression, and feature denoising. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance.\n\n**IV. Key Takeaways and Relevance to Image Classification**\n\nWhile this paper is focused on the SR task, several aspects are relevant to the general problem of adversarial robustness in image classification:\n\n1.  **Frequency Domain Defenses:**  The paper provides further evidence that analyzing and manipulating images in the frequency domain can be an effective strategy for mitigating adversarial attacks. It suggests that adversarial perturbations often manifest as high-frequency noise. This indicates that *frequency domain analysis is a valuable tool* in the development of robust image classification models.\n\n2.  **Adaptive Defenses:** The use of an adversarial sample classifier to selectively apply the frequency mask module demonstrates the benefit of adaptive defenses. *Activating defenses only when needed* reduces the performance penalty on clean images, which is a common problem with many robustness techniques.\n\n3.  **Randomization as a Defense:** The stochastic nature of the frequency mask (using a Bernoulli distribution) helps to prevent attackers from crafting adversarial examples specifically tailored to circumvent the defense.  *Randomization can be a powerful defense strategy*.\n\n4.  **Adversarial Training is Critical:**  The results emphasize the importance of adversarial training for achieving robustness. The combination of the frequency mask module *and* adversarial training yields the best performance. This reinforces the finding that *adversarial training is essential for building robust models*.\n\n5.  **Generalizability:** The paper demonstrates that the proposed defense mechanism can be integrated with various SR network architectures, suggesting that it could be adaptable to image classification models as well.\n\nIn summary, this paper presents a novel approach to adversarial robustness for image SR based on frequency domain analysis, adaptive masking, and adversarial training. While the specific architecture is tailored to super-resolution, the underlying principles and techniques (frequency domain defenses, adaptive defenses, randomization, and adversarial training) are relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness for image classification. The publication date (October 2021) falls within the specified timeframe of the last 2 years, making it a valuable resource for understanding recent trends in this area."

      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided research paper and extracted the information most relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Please note:** This paper primarily focuses on *volumetric medical image segmentation*, not general image classification. However, the techniques and findings are still relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the relevant information, organized for clarity:\n\n**1. Core Problem Addressed:**\n\n*   The paper addresses the vulnerability of deep learning models, specifically those used in *volumetric medical image segmentation (MIS)*, to adversarial attacks.  The authors argue that while DNNs have shown promise in MIS, their real-world deployment is hindered by these vulnerabilities.\n*   The paper highlights that adversarial attacks can lead to incorrect diagnoses and treatment plans, which is particularly critical in healthcare.\n*   It points out that the adversarial robustness of medical imaging models is an \"under-explored area,\" especially for *volumetric (3D) medical data*.\n\n**2. Proposed Solution & Key Contributions (relevant trends):**\n\n*   **Frequency Domain Adversarial Training:**  The main trend presented is the use of *frequency domain* techniques for adversarial training. The authors propose a *Volumetric Adversarial Frequency-domain Training (VAFT)* approach. This is motivated by observations that frequency-domain attacks are effective against defenses designed for pixel-domain (or voxel-domain in 3D) adversarial noise.\n\n    *   **VAFA (Volumetric Adversarial Frequency Attack):** A novel attack that operates in the frequency domain of the 3D medical data. It's designed to be more effective at fooling models compared to traditional voxel-domain attacks.\n    *   **Frequency Consistency Loss:**  A novel loss function introduced to regulate frequency domain adversarial training. It encourages the frequency representation of the *logits* (model's raw output) of clean and adversarial samples to be similar.  This is intended to improve the trade-off between performance on clean data and robustness against attacks.\n*   **Min-Max Objective:** The authors use a min-max optimization framework, common in adversarial training, but adapted for the frequency domain. The maximization step involves generating adversarial examples using VAFA, and the minimization step involves training the model on both clean and adversarial examples, incorporating the frequency consistency loss.\n\n**3. Technical Details & Methods (relevant trends):**\n\n*   **3D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT):** The core idea involves transforming volumetric medical data into the frequency domain using 3D DCT.\n*   **Frequency Perturbation Module (FPM):**  This module perturbs the DCT coefficients of the input data. It involves:\n\n    *   **Quantization:**  DCT coefficients are quantized using a *learnable quantization table* (`q`).  This table controls how much the DCT coefficients are modified.\n    *   **Differentiable Rounding:** A differentiable rounding operation is used during quantization, allowing the gradients to flow during training.\n    *   **Inverse DCT (IDCT):**  After perturbation in the frequency domain, an inverse DCT is applied to convert the data back to the voxel domain for model training.\n*   **Quantization Constraint:** A constraint is placed on the quantization table (`\u2225q\u2225\u221e \u2264 qmax`) to control the amount of perturbation introduced. A higher `qmax` leads to more information loss and a drop in perceptual quality.\n*   **Structural Similarity Loss (Lssim):**  This loss is *minimized* during the attack to maintain the perceptual similarity between clean and adversarial samples. This is a common technique to ensure the adversarial perturbations are subtle.\n*   **Adversarial Training Process (VAFT):**\n\n    1.  Generate adversarial samples using VAFA.\n    2.  Update model parameters by minimizing a combination of:\n        *   Dice loss (segmentation loss) on clean samples\n        *   Dice loss on adversarial samples\n        *   Frequency consistency loss\n\n**4. Experimental Results & Findings:**\n\n*   The proposed VAFA attack achieves a *higher fooling rate* compared to voxel-domain attacks (PGD, FGSM, BIM, Gaussian Noise) while maintaining comparable perceptual similarity (measured by LPIPS).\n*   The VAFT approach (adversarial training with frequency consistency loss) enhances the robustness of the volumetric segmentation model against both voxel-domain and frequency-domain attacks.\n*   The frequency consistency loss helps to improve/retain the performance of the robust model on clean images, which is a critical aspect of adversarial training (avoiding a significant drop in clean accuracy).\n*   Experiments were conducted using two popular medical segmentation models (UNETR, UNETR++) and two datasets (Synapse, ACDC).\n*   Parameter analysis was performed to study the impact of quantization threshold (`qmax`), number of attack steps, and patch size on attack effectiveness.\n\n**5. Limitations & Future Directions (Inferred):**\n\n*   The paper focuses solely on *volumetric medical image segmentation*.  The applicability of these techniques to other image classification tasks might require further investigation.\n*   The paper explores only a specific type of frequency-domain attack.  Other frequency-domain attack strategies could be explored.\n*   The computational cost of frequency-domain transformations (DCT/IDCT) might be a concern for large-scale applications.\n*   The authors note the field is rapidly evolving and suggest the need for continued research on new defense strategies.\n\n**6. Key Takeaways Regarding Trends in Adversarial Robustness (from the paper):**\n\n*   **Shift to Frequency Domain:** The paper clearly highlights a trend towards exploring the frequency domain for both *attacking* and *defending* against adversarial examples. This is based on the idea that defenses designed for pixel-level perturbations might be vulnerable to manipulations in the frequency domain.\n*   **Importance of Perceptual Similarity:** Maintaining the perceptual similarity between clean and adversarial samples remains a key focus.  The use of LPIPS and the minimization of structural similarity loss demonstrate this trend.\n*   **Adversarial Training Remains Central:** Adversarial training, although computationally expensive, continues to be a core technique for improving robustness. This paper focuses on improving adversarial training via frequency domain attacks.\n*   **Loss Function Engineering:** Novel loss functions, such as the frequency consistency loss proposed in the paper, are being developed to improve the effectiveness of adversarial training.  These loss functions often aim to regularize the model's behavior or enforce certain properties in the feature space.\n*   **3D Medical Imaging is a Growing Area:** The application of adversarial robustness techniques to 3D medical imaging is an important and under-explored area. Given the high stakes in medical applications, ensuring the reliability of these models is crucial.\n\n**7.

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** DAT: Improving Adversarial Robustness via Generative Amplitude Mix-up in Frequency Domain\n\n**Key Trend Identified:**  Focus on the Frequency Domain (specifically, manipulating amplitude in the frequency spectrum) and using Generative Models to improve adversarial training. The paper leverages the observation that adversarial attacks disproportionately impact the *phase* of an image's frequency spectrum, while the *amplitude* is relatively less affected.\n\n**Specific Contributions & Techniques (DAT \u2013 Dual Adversarial Training):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Amplitude Generation (AAG):**\n    *   Proposes a novel Adversarial Amplitude Generator (AAG). This is a *key trend* as it uses a generative model (G\u03c8) to synthesize an adversarial amplitude spectrum.\n    *   The AAG aims to create an amplitude that maximizes the model's loss, forcing the model to focus on the phase patterns which are more resistant to adversarial perturbations.\n    *   The generator is optimized *adversarially*, meaning it's trained to *fool* the primary image classification model.\n*   **Dual Adversarial Training (DAT):**\n    *   Integrates the AAG into a dual adversarial training scheme. This involves:\n        *   Generating adversarial examples (AEs) of *both* original images and images with manipulated amplitudes.\n        *   Jointly optimizing the image classification model and the AAG.\n        *   This joint optimization is a min-max problem: minimizing the loss for the classifier (making it robust) and maximizing the loss for the amplitude generator (making it generate effective adversarial amplitudes).\n*   **Efficient AE Generation:**  Addresses the computational cost of generating AEs for both original and amplitude-modified images. It suggests a loss function (`LAE`) to increase the adversarial perturbation length in each iteration, allowing fewer iterations to reach the \"actual maximum\" in the L\u221e-ball (a measure of perturbation magnitude). Specifically, LAE uses a combination of cross-entropy loss (LCE) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the benign sample and its AE, as shown in Eq. (5):\n     LAE(f\u03b8(x), f\u03b8(x\u2032), y) = LCE(f\u03b8(x\u2032), y) + \u03b2 \u22c5 DKL(f\u03b8(x\u2032), f\u03b8(x))\n*   **Amplitude Mix-up:** The method doesn't entirely replace the original amplitude with the generated one. It uses a mix-up operation:  `Amix(x) = \u03bb \u00b7 AG(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u00b7 A(x)`.  This is likely to prevent the generated amplitude from completely destroying the original image's structure, which could hinder training. This mixup operation addresses this by ensuring that a portion of the original amplitude information is preserved.\n*   **Consistency Regularization:**  Uses Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence to encourage prediction consistency between original images and their amplitude-modified counterparts.  This helps the model focus on phase patterns, even when the amplitude has been changed. The loss term is incorporated into LDAT as: LDAT(f\u03b8(x), f\u03b8(\u02c6x), y) = 1/2 [LAT(f\u03b8(x), y) + LAT(f\u03b8(\u02c6x), y)) + \u03c9 \u22c5 DJS(f\u03b8(x), f\u03b8(\u02c6x))].\n\n**Key Findings/Experimental Results:**\n\n*   DAT achieves significant improvements in robustness against various adversarial attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods. Reported improvements (using ResNet-18) include:\n    *   ~2.1% on CIFAR-10\n    *   ~2.2% on CIFAR-100\n    *   ~2.3% on Tiny ImageNet\n*   Experiments confirm that adversarial perturbations significantly impact *phase* patterns. Mixing amplitude with that of a distractor image enhances robustness against AEs.\n*   Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of each component of DAT (AAG, mix-up, consistency regularization, split Batch Normalization).\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends):**\n\n1.  **Frequency Domain Manipulation:**  The core idea of manipulating images in the frequency domain (specifically the amplitude) to improve robustness is a trend seen in recent research.\n2.  **Generative Models for Adversarial Training:** The use of a generative model (AAG) within the adversarial training loop to create more effective adversarial examples is a prominent and growing trend.\n3.  **Data Augmentation in Frequency Domain:** Mixing the training samples' amplitude with randomly selected distractor to improve adversarial phase patterns.\n4.  **Improved Adversarial Training Efficiency:** The optimized loss (`LAE`) and training strategies (split BNs, mix-up) are specifically designed to make adversarial training more efficient, which addresses a common bottleneck in these techniques.  Efficient training is a key consideration for making AT practical.\n\n**Methods Compared Against (Baselines - to provide context for what \"state-of-the-art\" means):**\n\n*   PGD-AT\n*   TRADES\n*   MART\n*   LAS-AT\n*   SCARL\n*   ST\n*   OA-AT\n*   DAJAT\n*   IDBH\n\n**Model Architectures Used:**\n\n*   ResNet-18\n*   WideResNet-28-10 (WRN-28-10)\n*   WideResNet-34-10 (WRN-34-10)\n\n**Datasets Used:**\n\n*   CIFAR-10\n*   CIFAR-100\n*   Tiny ImageNet\n\n**Supporting Information (From Appendix):**\n\n*   Pseudocode for AE generation and DAT algorithms.\n*   Detailed experimental setup.\n*   Ablation studies.\n*   Theoretical analysis and proofs related to the AAG's effectiveness.\n*   Visualization of amplitude spectrum manipulation.\n*   Analysis of Batch Normalization parameters.\n\n**In summary, this paper demonstrates a latest trend in adversarial robustness by focusing on frequency domain manipulation using a novel Adversarial Amplitude Generator (AAG) integrated into a Dual Adversarial Training (DAT) framework.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper regarding the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on the last 2 years.  I'll extract the key aspects and present them in a structured manner.\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper**\n\n*   The paper introduces \"PatchCleanser,\" a defense mechanism against adversarial patch attacks on image classification models.  It aims to provide certified robustness, meaning it guarantees correct classification for specific images even against adaptive, white-box attackers.\n*   A key contribution is that PatchCleanser is designed to be \"architecture-agnostic,\" meaning it can work with any image classifier, unlike some previous defenses.\n*   It uses a double-masking technique in the image space to neutralize the effects of the adversarial patch.\n\n**Key Trends and Gaps Identified in the Last 2 Years (Specifically Mentioned in the Paper):**\n\nThe paper directly addresses the limitations of existing trends in adversarial robustness (published within the last 2 years from the paper's publication date):\n\n1.  **Dependence on Specific Model Architectures:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** Many existing certifiably robust defenses, especially against patch attacks, are heavily reliant on specific model architectures, most commonly those with *small receptive fields*. (See references [7, 27, 29, 35, 61, 67]). These are defenses from the last 2 years.\n    *   **Limitation:** Small receptive fields limit the amount of information each feature can receive, resulting in reduced classification accuracy.\n        *   Example: The best top-1 clean accuracy on ImageNet achieved by prior certifiably robust defenses is around 55%, while state-of-the-art *undefended* classification models can achieve 80%-90%.\n        *   The paper argues that poor clean accuracy hinders real-world deployment and ultimately limits achievable robustness.\n\n2.  **Abstention from Predictions:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** Some defenses, like Minority Reports (MR) [32], address the model architecture dependence issue. However, their robustness guarantee is weaker as they can only *detect* patch attacks and abstain from making a prediction. This paper is from the last 2 years.\n    *   **Limitation:** Attackers can force the model to *always* abstain, which is problematic in applications requiring continuous predictions (e.g., autonomous vehicles).\n\n3.  **Scalability Issues:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** Some earlier certified defenses, particularly those using Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) [7], suffer from scalability issues. This defense is from the last 2 years.\n    *   **Limitation:** They are computationally expensive and often only applicable to small classification models and low-resolution images.  This limits their real-world applicability.\n\n**PatchCleanser's Proposed Solution & Contributions (Addresses the Trends and Gaps):**\n\nTo directly combat the limitations of the trends above, PatchCleanser offers:\n\n*   **Architecture-Agnostic Certified Robustness:**\n\n    *   Designed to work with *any* image classifier. The core idea is to robustly \"remove/mask\" adversarial pixels so accurate predictions can be obtained from any state-of-the-art classifier.\n    *   This is achieved through a double-masking algorithm.\n\n*   **No Abstention:**\n\n    *   PatchCleanser aims to always provide a prediction, maintaining functionality in critical applications.\n\n*   **Scalability:**\n\n    *   Designed to be efficient enough to scale to high-resolution images, taking advantage of the capabilities of state-of-the-art models.\n\n**PatchCleanser's Double-Masking Algorithm (Core of the Defense):**\n\n1.  **First Round:** Masks are applied to the input image, and model predictions are evaluated for each masked image. The mask set is designed so at least one mask will remove the entire patch.\n2.  **Second Round:**  If the first round reveals a disagreement in predictions (indicating a possible attack), a second set of masks is applied to each of the *disagreeing* masked images from the first round.  Inconsistencies in these two-mask predictions are used to filter out malicious one-mask predictions.\n3.  **Majority/Disagreer Handling:** The algorithm distinguishes between \"majority\" predictions (most frequent label) and \"disagreer\" predictions. The second round of masking helps determine if a disagreer prediction is actually the correct one.\n\n**Key Elements for Certifiable Robustness:**\n\n*   **R-covering Mask Set:**  The mask set must have the property that *at least one* mask in the set can cover the entire adversarial patch, *regardless* of its location.\n*   **Two-Mask Correctness:**  The model must predict the correct class label for *all* possible images masked with *any combination of two masks* from the mask set. This is the sufficient condition for certified robustness.\n\n**Evaluation & Results:**\n\n*   PatchCleanser is evaluated with ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and ResMLP on datasets like ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10.\n*   Results demonstrate state-of-the-art clean accuracy (close to undefended models) *and* significantly improved certified robust accuracy compared to previous defenses (e.g., IBP [7], Clipped BagNet [67], De-randomized Smoothing [27], PatchGuard [61], BagCert [35]). This is especially noticeable against 2% pixel square patches on ImageNet.\n* The paper highlights that the certified robust accuracy is a *lower bound* of model accuracy against *any* adaptive attacker within the defined threat model.\n\n**Areas for Future Work (Identified in the Paper):**\n\n*   **Improving Defense Efficiency:** Reducing the computational overhead of PatchCleanser to make it more practical.\n*   **Relaxing the Prior Estimation of Patch Shape/Size:** Reducing the dependence on knowing the size and shape of the adversarial patch in advance.\n*   **Improving Classification Models' Prediction Invariance to Pixel Masking:** Training models to be more robust to masking operations inherently.\n*   **Handling Potential Semantic Changes Caused by Masks:** Addressing scenarios where masking might alter the meaning of the image for specific classification tasks.\n\n**In summary,** the paper identifies the limitations of existing adversarial robustness approaches in the last 2 years, specifically the reliance on specific model architectures, issues with abstention, and scalability problems.  PatchCleanser is presented as a solution that addresses these limitations with its architecture-agnostic design, guaranteed prediction output, and potential for scaling to high-resolution images, achieving significant improvements in certified robustness."

      "relevancy": "This paper explores efficient adversarial defense for image classification using pre-trained models on ImageNet, which is relevant to the research question and falls within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided paper, focusing on the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, with emphasis on information from the last 2 years (approximately since the end of 2021, given the paper was likely written in late 2023 or early 2024).\n\n**I. Core Idea and Proposed Defense (Key-Based Defense with Pre-trained Models and Fine-tuning)**\n\n*   **Key Trend:** The paper addresses the ongoing challenge of adversarial robustness by exploring key-based defense mechanisms, specifically for image classification. This approach leverages cryptographic principles to provide an information advantage to the defender.\n*   **Problem Addressed:** The paper identifies limitations of previous key-based defenses:\n    *   Training many classifiers from scratch is computationally expensive.\n    *   Prior key-based defenses haven't been thoroughly tested on large datasets like ImageNet.\n*   **Proposed Solution:** The authors propose a new approach to create key-based defenses that involves leveraging pre-trained models (specifically, a Vision Transformer (ViT) pre-trained on ImageNet-21k) and efficient fine-tuning techniques (LoRA) to generate multiple defended models.\n*   **One-Key-One-Model Paradigm:** They emphasize a \"one-key-one-model\" scenario, where each classifier has its own unique key, making adversarial attacks less transferable. This paradigm is becoming increasingly relevant due to the growing deployment of models on edge devices.\n\n**II. Key Concepts and Techniques**\n\n*   **Key-Based Defense:** The core idea involves embedding a secret key into the model structure. This key controls a transformation applied to the input image, making adversarial attacks ineffective without knowledge of the key. The authors use block-wise pixel shuffling as the key-based transformation.\n*   **Pre-trained Models:** The paper leverages the success of pre-trained models, specifically a ViT model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k. This reduces training costs and improves generalization. They utilize a pre-trained ViT base model with patch size of 16.\n*   **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** This is an efficient fine-tuning technique designed for large language models, but the authors apply it to image classification. LoRA freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the transformer block. This significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters. They used a low-rank dimension value r = 16 and a scaling factor of 16.\n*   **Block-wise Pixel Shuffling:** Divide a three-channel (RGB) color image into non-overlapping blocks. Generate a random permutation vector with key K. For each block, flatten the three-channel block of pixels into a vector and permute pixels with the permutation vector generated.\n\n**III. Threat Model and Evaluation**\n\n*   **Threat Model:** The authors consider a gray-box adversary with knowledge of the model architecture, access to pre-trained models, training data, and the key-based defense mechanism (but *not* the secret key). They consider a p-norm bounded threat model.\n*   **Attack Strategy:** They use the AutoAttack (AA) strategy, a suite of both targeted and untargeted attacks, to evaluate the robustness of their defense.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** They measure classification accuracy for both clean and adversarial examples. They also distinguish between non-adaptive attacks (attacks generated directly on the pre-trained model) and adaptive attacks (attacks generated using a substitute model fine-tuned with a guessed key). They used AA's \"standard\" version with a perturbation budget value of 4/255 under \u2113\u221e norm and a value of 0.5 under \u21132 norm for all attacks.\n\n**IV. Experimental Results and Findings**\n\n*   **Superior Performance:** The proposed fine-tuned key-based models achieved a superior classification accuracy (more than 10% increase) compared to previous key-based models and adversarial training (AT) methods.\n*   **Robustness Against Non-Adaptive Attacks:** Adversarial examples generated on the pre-trained model were not effective on the fine-tuned models.\n*   **Vulnerability of LoRA Models to Adaptive Attacks:** Adaptive attacks were successful on LoRA fine-tuned models, especially for the models with P = 8 and 16. The authors suspect that the LoRA applied patch embedding layer in ViT-B/16 does not fully capture the key-based transformation.\n*   **Full Fine-tuning Robustness:** Fully fine-tuned models were robust against adaptive attacks.\n\n**V. Key Takeaways and Trends**\n\n*   **Key-Based Defenses are Promising:** The paper reinforces the potential of key-based defenses as a viable approach to adversarial robustness, particularly in scenarios where models are deployed on edge devices.\n*   **Pre-trained Models and Fine-Tuning are Crucial:** Leveraging pre-trained models and efficient fine-tuning techniques (like LoRA, although with caveats) is essential for making key-based defenses practical for large datasets like ImageNet.\n*   **Adaptive Attacks Remain a Challenge:** While the proposed defense shows promise, adaptive attacks, where the adversary is aware of the defense mechanism, can still be effective, especially against LoRA-based fine-tuning. More work is needed to enhance robustness against these attacks.\n*   **Importance of One-Key-One-Model:** The paper emphasizes the practical relevance of the \"one-key-one-model\" approach in modern edge computing environments, highlighting the need for defenses that can prevent the transfer of adversarial examples between models.\n\n**VI. Limitations and Future Work**\n\n*   **Limited Attack Types:** The authors primarily focus on p-norm bounded adversaries (AutoAttack strategy).\n*   **LoRA Fine-tuning Needs Improvement:** The LoRA fine-tuned models are vulnerable to adaptive attacks.\n*   **Future Research Directions:**\n    *   Investigating different attack types (patch attacks, unrestricted adversarial examples).\n    *   Improving adversarial robustness in LoRA fine-tuned models.\n\n**In summary:** This paper contributes to the ongoing research on adversarial robustness by presenting a practical and effective key-based defense mechanism that leverages pre-trained models and efficient fine-tuning. The work highlights the importance of adaptive attacks and suggests avenues for future research to improve the robustness of LoRA-based defenses. The emphasis on the \"one-key-one-model\" paradigm reflects the increasing relevance of edge computing and the need for defenses tailored to these environments. The use of LoRA is fairly recent and highlights the trend of efficient adaptation of models for adversarial defense."

The perturbation is calculated as: `\u03b7 = \u03f5 * sign(\u2207xJ(\u03b8, x, y))`. The paper uses FGSM *in conjunction with GradCAM* to target specific image features.\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**  GANs are used to create adversarial examples for *text* classification, generating synthetic data that causes misclassification in fraud detection models. The specific GAN variant used is Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN).\n    *   **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE):** SMOTE is used *in conjunction with GANs* to oversample adversarial examples, further enhancing the impact of the attack on text classifiers.\n    *   **Gradient Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM):**  Used to identify the most important features in images that the CNN uses for classification.  This allows the FGSM attack to be more targeted.\n\n3.  **Datasets Used:**\n    *   **Financial Fraud Data (Kaggle):**  Used for text classification experiments.\n    *   **Olivetti Faces Dataset (AT&T Laboratories Cambridge):** Used for image classification (facial recognition) experiments.\n\n4.  **Model Performance Degradation:**\n    *   **Text Classification:**  A 20% decrease in accuracy for text classification models post-attack is observed.\n    *   **Facial Recognition:** A 30% decrease in facial recognition accuracy is observed.\n\n5.  **Argument for Robust Defenses:** The authors explicitly state,  \"The significant drop in performance after introducing adversarial examples highlights an urgent need for robust adversarial defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training or input sanitization techniques, to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\" This implicitly acknowledges that improving robustness is a key area of research.\n\n**Why This Paper is NOT a Primary Source for \"Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness\":**\n\n*   **Focus on Attacks, Not Defenses:** The paper's primary contribution is demonstrating the *vulnerability* of models, not proposing or evaluating new defense mechanisms.  It uses existing attack methods.\n*   **Limited Discussion of Robustness Techniques:**  It mentions \"adversarial training or input sanitization techniques\" but doesn't delve into specific advancements or compare different robustness approaches.\n*   **Lack of Comparative Analysis:** The paper doesn't compare the effectiveness of different adversarial defense strategies or analyze their strengths and weaknesses.\n*   **The related works section focuses on attacks, not defenses.**\n\n**How to Use this Paper (If Necessary) in Context of the Research Question:**\n\nIf you *must* use this paper, you could frame it as:\n\n*   Evidence of the ongoing *need* for adversarial robustness research. The paper demonstrates that models remain vulnerable to attacks, highlighting the importance of developing more robust defenses.\n*   A use case for evaluating robustness techniques. The specific attack strategies outlined in the paper (GAN+SMOTE for text, GradCAM+FGSM for images) could be used as benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of different defense mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile this paper is about adversarial attacks, it doesn't provide direct information on the latest trends in *adversarial robustness*.  It primarily demonstrates the *lack* of robustness in the models it tests. Therefore, it is not a strong primary source for answering your research question. You would need to find other papers that directly focus on *defense* mechanisms and robustness improvements."

It acknowledges prior work using GANs for this purpose but highlights the limitations in terms of diversity, controllability, and training instability.\n*   **Text-to-Image Diffusion Models:** The core novelty is using large-scale pre-trained Text-to-Text (T2T) and Text-to-Image (T2I) models (specifically diffusion models).  Diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) have become a dominant trend in generative modeling and are positioned as superior to GANs for GDA due to their diversity and controllability.  The paper leverages GLIDE (Nichol et al., 2022) and potentially Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) as T2I models.\n*   **Data Augmentation for Adversarial Robustness:** The abstract and introduction explicitly state that TTIDA is designed to increase robustness.

It moves beyond GANs by leveraging recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models and text-to-text models.  TTIDA demonstrates that generating diverse and controllable synthetic data, conditioned on textual descriptions, can enhance model robustness against adversarial examples and unusual image styles, particularly in low-resource scenarios.  The paper's experiments provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of this approach.\n\n**Caveats:**\n\n*   The paper doesn't explicitly compare against other adversarial training techniques directly.\n*   The adversarial images used in the experiments are collected manually from the Internet, which might not be a standardized adversarial attack method.\n*   The paper doesn't deeply explore different adversarial attack strategies.\n\nDespite the caveats, the paper offers valuable insights into using generative data augmentation with T2T and T2I models to improve adversarial robustness, which is a relevant trend in image classification research."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** ROBUSTIFYING DEEP VISION MODELS THROUGH SHAPE SENSITIZATION\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nThe paper proposes a novel adversarial augmentation technique called ELEAS (Edge Learning for Shape sensitivity) to improve the adversarial robustness of image classification models by increasing their shape sensitivity. ELEAS augments training data with superpositions of edgemaps and patch-shuffled images, incentivizing models to learn holistic shapes rather than relying on textures.\n\n**Methodology (ELEAS):**\n\n1.  **Shape and Texture Extraction:**\n    *   Shapes are approximated using edge maps extracted via a Laplacian kernel.\n    *   Textures are generated by shuffling 2x2 patches within images.\n2.  **Augmentation Generation:**\n    *   Superimposed images are created by combining a randomly selected edgemap (`s` from the set of shapes `S`) and a randomly selected shuffled-patch image (`t` from the set of textures `T`) using the following formula: `is = \u03bb * t + (1 - \u03bb) * s`, where `\u03bb` is drawn from a Beta distribution. The label of the augmented image is the label of the edgemap image.\n3.  **Training Procedure:**\n    *   Mini-batches contain half natural images and half augmented images.\n    *   A weighted cross-entropy loss is used: `L(I, B, yI, yB) = \u03b7 * CE(I, yI) + (1 - \u03b7) * CE(B, yB)`, where `\u03b7` controls shape sensitivity.\n    *   The model must learn to identify the shape (edges) from the edgemap image while ignoring distracting edges and textures from the shuffled image.\n\n**Experimental Results and Findings:**\n\n*   **Improved Classification Accuracy and Robustness:**  ELEAS achieves significant gains in classification accuracy and robustness compared to vanilla training and a shape-texture debiasing method called TSD (Li et al., 2021a)\n    *   Up to 6% absolute gain on ImageNet-1K classification accuracy for ViT-Small.\n    *   Up to 28% gain on the ImageNet-A dataset (natural adversarial examples) for ViT-B.\n    *   Up to 8.5% gain on the ImageNet-R dataset (renditions) for ViT-S.\n    *   14.2% improvement on ImageNet-C (corrupted images) classification performance for Resnet152.\n    *   5.89% increase in shape-bias for Resnet152.\n\n*   **Increased Shape Sensitivity:**  Models trained with ELEAS exhibit increased shape sensitivity, which is correlated with improved robustness and classification accuracy. This is validated using various probe datasets and metrics.\n    *   Increased shape factor (fraction of dimensions encoding shape cues).\n    *   Improved performance on datasets requiring shape recognition (Edge, Silhouette, Sketch)\n\n*   **Out-of-Distribution Generalization:** Evaluated on ImageNet-A, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-Sketch datasets. Significant improvements were observed compared to models trained using standard methods and the TSD method.\n*   **Lightweight Augmentation:** The ELEAS augmentation technique is computationally efficient compared to GAN-based methods like those used in TSD (Li et al., 2021a). Edge maps and shuffled patches can be pre-computed, making it faster per epoch.\n\n**Baselines Compared:**\n\n*   Vanilla training (standard training without specialized robustness techniques)\n*   TSD (Shape-Texture Debiased Neural Network Training, Li et al., 2021a): A method that uses stylized ImageNet images to encourage models to focus on both shape and texture.\n\n**Models Used:**\n\n*   CNNs: ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152\n*   Vision Transformers (ViTs): ViT-Small, ViT-Base, ViT-Large\n\n**Datasets Used:**\n\n*   ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 (for training and evaluation)\n*   ImageNet-A (natural adversarial examples)\n*   ImageNet-R (renditions: art, cartoons, etc.)\n*   ImageNet-C (common corruptions)\n*   ImageNet-Sketch\n*   Pascal VOC 2012 (for evaluating shape decodability)\n*   Cue-conflict (stylized images with conflicting shape and texture)\n*   Stylized-ImageNet (SIN)\n\n**Key Related Work (Within the last 2 years):**\n\n*   Li et al.

(2021): Out-of-distribution benchmark\n\n**Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Based on this paper):**\n\n1.  **Shape Bias as a Key Factor:**  The paper strongly suggests that increasing the shape bias of image classification models is a promising direction for improving adversarial robustness.  Models that are more sensitive to shape are less susceptible to texture-based attacks and generalize better to out-of-distribution data.\n2.  **Data Augmentation Techniques:** Adversarial data augmentation continues to be a prominent trend. The paper introduces a lightweight and effective augmentation strategy to improve shape sensitivity.  It shows how carefully designed augmentations can encourage models to learn more robust features.\n3.  **Vision Transformers (ViTs):** The paper explores the effectiveness of shape-biased training on ViTs, demonstrating that the benefits of increased shape sensitivity extend beyond CNNs.\n4.  **Focus on Efficiency:**  The design of ELEAS emphasizes computational efficiency.  This highlights a trend towards developing robustness techniques that can be applied without excessive computational overhead, making them more practical for real-world applications.\n5.  **Evaluation on Diverse Datasets:**  The paper's evaluation protocol includes a wide range of datasets designed to assess different aspects of robustness (natural adversarial examples, common corruptions, out-of-distribution generalization, shape bias). This emphasizes the importance of comprehensive evaluation when developing and comparing robustness techniques.\n\n**Limitations Acknowledged:**\n\n*   The shape bias metric proposed by Geirhos et al.

It investigates methods to make adversarial training more efficient for these computationally intensive models, and proposes Attention-Guided Adversarial Training (AGAT) which speeds up training while maintaining robustness.\n\n**Key Information Extracted Relevant to the Research Question:**\n\n1.  **ViTs and Adversarial Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that ViTs, despite their state-of-the-art performance in many vision tasks, are vulnerable to adversarial examples, similar to CNNs. This vulnerability has been intensively studied in recent works ([11,52,9,44,7,1,60,84,29,46,45,48,64,32,22] - citations in the original paper).\n*   Fu et al. [22] specifically studied attacking ViTs in a patch-wise approach, revealing unique vulnerabilities of ViTs. This indicates a trend toward understanding *specific* vulnerabilities related to the architecture of ViTs.\n\n2.  **Adversarial Training as a Defense:**\n\n*   Adversarial training is presented as one of the most effective methods for improving the robustness of both CNNs and ViTs. This is a continuing trend; however, the computational cost is a major limitation.\n*   The paper focuses on *fast* adversarial training methods to mitigate the computational expense.\n\n3.  **Computational Challenges with ViTs:**\n\n*   ViTs, due to their self-attention mechanism, are computationally expensive, especially during adversarial training. The computational cost of self-attention increases quadratically with the number of input patches.\n*   The paper notes that large ViT models can suffer from catastrophic overfitting, which degrades robustness.\n\n4.  **Fast Adversarial Training (Fast AT) Investigation:**\n\n*   The authors performed a comprehensive study of Fast AT applied to various ViT architectures (ViT, CaiT, LeViT, SwinTransformer, and CrossFormer).\n*   The study revealed that larger ViTs do not always lead to better robustness due to overfitting. Constrained attention mechanisms (like those in SwinTransformer) can alleviate this issue.\n*   The attention mechanism designed for better natural performance does *not* necessarily result in better robustness.\n*   State-of-the-art ViTs have a significant efficiency problem, requiring much more training time than state-of-the-art CNNs.\n\n5.  **Attention-Guided Adversarial Training (AGAT): A Proposed Solution**\n\n*   AGAT is proposed as a mechanism to accelerate adversarial training on ViTs. It leverages the ability of ViTs to process variable-length inputs.\n*   AGAT drops image patches based on attention information (specifically, dropping patches with lower attention scores) at each self-attention layer. The rationale is to preserve the most important information for gradient estimation during adversarial example generation.\n*   The method is designed to maintain training quality while significantly reducing training time (reportedly matching state-of-the-art robustness with only 65% of the training time in some experiments).\n*   The method only modifies the training process, and the original model is used during inference.\n\n6.  **Key Experimental Results / Findings**\n\n*   AGAT achieves comparable clean performance and robust accuracy to Fast-AT but with significantly less training time on ImageNet.\n*   The paper demonstrates that random patch dropping stabilizes adversarial training but hurts robustness, whereas AGAT addresses this dilemma by selectively dropping patches based on attention.\n*   Ablation studies confirm that AGAT maintains robustness across various adversarial attacks and dropping rates.\n*   Visualization of dropped patches shows that AGAT primarily removes patches from less important regions (e.g., background).\n\n7. **Related Works analysis**\n* Mentions related works that explore multiple-step adversarial training to ViTs [68, 6] and studies that test the vanilla adversarial training on CIFAR10 [63].\n* Mentions that techniques such as variable-resolution training [81] have been unusable.\n\n**Trends Observable from the Paper:**\n\n*   **Focus on Efficiency:**  A major trend is the development of techniques to make adversarial training computationally feasible for large models like ViTs. This includes exploring fast adversarial training algorithms and methods to reduce computational complexity during training.\n*   **Architectural Considerations:**  Adversarial robustness is not just about training methods; it's also tied to the architecture of the neural network. The paper shows that certain architectural choices (e.g., constrained attention) can improve robustness and mitigate overfitting during adversarial training.\n*   **Attention Mechanisms and Robustness:** Using attention mechanisms to guide the training process, as demonstrated by AGAT, shows a trend toward leveraging the internal workings of ViTs to improve robustness in an intelligent way.\n*   **Patch-based Vulnerabilities:** Research is being done to assess the adversarial robustness of ViTs by attacking them in a patch-wise approach, which reveals the unique vulnerability of ViTs.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on *single-step* fast adversarial training. The effectiveness of AGAT with more complex, multi-step adversarial training methods might warrant further investigation.\n*   The experimental results are primarily on ImageNet. Generalizability to other datasets and tasks should be considered.\n\nIn summary, this paper contributes to the trend of making adversarial training practical for Vision Transformers by addressing their computational demands. The proposed AGAT method and the insights gained from the Fast AT study offer valuable information for researchers working on adversarial robustness in image classification."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** When Adversarial Training Meets Vision Transformers: Recipes from Training to Architecture (Published in NeurIPS 2022)\n\n**Focus and Scope:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs), specifically exploring effective adversarial training recipes and architectural modifications to improve robustness.\n*   It is within the last 2 years of research.\n\n**Key Findings and Trends Related to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n1.  **Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n    *   Naturally trained ViTs (without adversarial training) are **not inherently more robust than CNNs** against adversarial attacks, especially on popular threat models (larger perturbation budgets).  This contradicts earlier suggestions of inherent robustness to small perturbations.\n    *   Adversarial training is essential for ViTs to achieve meaningful adversarial robustness.\n\n2.  **Adversarial Training Recipes for ViTs:**\n\n    *   **Pre-training:** Natural pre-training on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K or ImageNet-21K) is **necessary** for successful adversarial training of ViTs.  Training from scratch leads to underfitting and poor robustness. The paper finds that ImageNet-1K pretraining is sufficient and ImageNet-21K does not necessarily provide additional benefit.\n    *   **Gradient Clipping:** Gradient clipping is essential for stable adversarial training of ViTs, preventing gradient explosion issues. This is particularly important for ViT and DeiT architectures.\n    *   **Optimizer:** SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) performs better than AdamW for adversarial training of ViTs.  This is opposite to the typical preference for AdamW in natural training of ViTs.\n    *   **Learning Rate Scheduler:** A piecewise learning rate scheduler (step decay) is preferred for SGD when adversarially training ViTs. Cyclic schedulers work better for AdamW.\n    *   **Data Augmentation:** Suitable combinations of data augmentation techniques (CutMix and Mixup) can directly improve the adversarial robustness of ViTs *without* requiring model weight averaging (which is often needed for CNNs). RandAugment can sometimes hurt performance, suggesting it's too difficult for adversarial training.\n    *   **Training Epochs:**  Increasing the number of training epochs beyond a certain point (e.g., 40 epochs in their setup) does not necessarily improve robustness and may even hurt performance.\n    *   **Practical Recipe for ViTs:** 1) Pre-training and gradient clipping are almost necessary. 2) Incorporating advanced data augmentations (e.g., Cutmix and Mixup) and adopting SGD optimizer with piecewise learning rate scheduler are preferred. 3) There seems no need to train longer epochs for the robustness improvement.\n\n3.  **Architectural Considerations for Robust ViTs:**\n\n    *   The paper proposes two novel methods leveraging ViT's architecture to further improve robustness:\n\n        *   **Attention Random Dropping (ARD):** Randomly masks gradients from some attention blocks during backpropagation within adversarial training.  This acts as a warming-up strategy, starting with higher masking probability and gradually reducing it.\n        *   **Perturbation Random Masking (PRM):** Randomly masks perturbations on some image patches during adversarial example generation.  Similar to ARD, it's used as a warming-up strategy.\n\n    *   Combining ARD and PRM provides further improvements in adversarial robustness.\n    *   The hyperparameter for the warming up period `nw` (epochs) can be easily tuned and the approach is not sensitive to the hyperparameter.\n    *   Increasing the size of the ViT can improve accuracy and robustness.\n\n4.  **Comparison with CNNs:**\n\n    *   On low-resolution datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10), ViTs do not inherently offer better adversarial robustness than CNNs, even with adversarial training.\n    *   However, on higher-resolution datasets (e.g., ImageNette, ImageNet-1K), ViTs can outperform CNNs in terms of adversarial robustness, especially when combined with the proposed training recipes and architectural modifications (ARD and PRM).\n    *   Gradient clipping has almost no effect on the robustness of CNNs. This indicates the necessity of gradient clipping is specific for ViTs.\n\n5.  **Combination with Other Defense Methods**\n    *   ARD and PRM can be easily combined with other stronger defense methods such as TRADES and MART.\n\n**Specific Details and Results:**\n\n*   The paper presents detailed experimental results on CIFAR-10 and Imagenette datasets using various ViT architectures (ViT-B, Swin-B, DeiT-S) and comparing different training techniques.\n*   It shows that the combination of SGD optimizer and piecewise learning rate scheduler helps improve both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.\n*   The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ARD and PRM in improving the adversarial robustness of ViTs on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet-1K, where they achieve state-of-the-art results (38.61% robustness).\n\n**Code:**\n\n*   Code is available at https://github.com/mo666666/When-Adversarial-Training-Meets-Vision-Transformers\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper highlights the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification using ViTs:\n\n*   Focus on adversarial training as the primary defense.\n*   Importance of pre-training, gradient clipping, and optimizer selection (SGD).\n*   Use of data augmentation techniques.\n*   Exploration of architecture-specific defenses (ARD and PRM).\n*   ViTs showing promise in adversarial robustness on higher-resolution datasets, potentially surpassing CNNs when properly trained."

      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided research paper to extract the most relevant information concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, with a focus on papers from the last 2 years. Here's a breakdown of my findings:\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper investigates the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It specifically examines the role of Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA) in ViT robustness.\n*   The authors propose a theoretical framework based on the Cauchy Problem to analyze and quantify ViT robustness.\n*   The paper challenges some existing empirical claims about ViTs' superior robustness, particularly the assertion that MSA always enhances robustness.\n\n**Key Findings and Trends Related to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n1.  **ViTs vs. CNNs Robustness:**\n\n    *   The paper acknowledges existing research showing ViTs can be more robust than CNNs under natural corruptions and some adversarial perturbations.\n    *   However, it highlights that ViTs may be more vulnerable to certain attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD).\n\n2.  **The Role of MSA (Multi-head Self-Attention):**\n\n    *   A major focus of the paper is debunking the idea that MSA inherently improves adversarial robustness.\n    *   The authors' theoretical and empirical studies suggest that MSA's impact on robustness is more nuanced:\n        *   MSA can improve robustness under *weak* attacks (e.g., FGSM).\n        *   MSA can *compromise* robustness under *strong* attacks (e.g., PGD).\n    *   The paper suggests that under stronger attacks, the translation invariance of CNNs has more defensive power.\n\n3.  **Theoretical Framework for Analyzing ViT Robustness:**\n\n    *   The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework that connects ViT robustness to the Cauchy Problem.\n    *   This framework is based on the idea that ViTs, similar to ResNets, can be viewed as a Forward Euler approximation of an underlying Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE).\n    *   The paper proves that ViTs are Lipschitz continuous, which is crucial for establishing this theoretical framework.\n    *   A key result from the framework is that the maximum singular value of the Jacobian of each block in the ViT architecture determines the local robustness.  Specifically, lower maximum singular values are correlated with greater robustness.\n\n4.  **Layer-Specific Robustness:**\n\n    *   The authors find that the first and last layers of the ViT encoder are the most critical factors affecting the model's robustness.\n\n5.  **Importance of Patch Size:**\n\n    *   The experimental results indicate that a larger patch size generally leads to better adversarial robustness for both ViTs and their convolutional counterparts (CoViTs).\n\n6.  **The Role of Input Bounding:**\n\n    *   The paper notes that unlike some previous work claiming transformers are not Lipschitz continuous, ViTs *are* Lipschitz continuous because the inputs are bounded.\n\n**Specific Attacks Investigated:**\n\n*   FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)\n*   PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) with L-infinity and L2 norms.\n*   CW (Carlini/Wagner) attack.\n*   Adversarial Patch Attacks (mentioned in the introduction)\n*   Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are mentioned from related work.\n\n**Experimental Setup:**\n\n*   The authors compare ViTs with modified versions called \"CoViTs,\" where self-attention is replaced with 1D convolutional layers.\n*   Experiments are conducted on CIFAR10.\n*   The Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer is used during training.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   The authors acknowledge several limitations:\n    *   Approximations inherent in modeling ViTs as ODEs.\n    *   Approximations in the Taylor expansion used in the theoretical analysis.\n    *   Use of an upper bound to approximate the maximum singular value of the Jacobian for large images.\n    *   The study mainly focuses on small to moderate-sized models to avoid the influence of pre-training and computational limitations.\n\n**Relevance to the Last 2 Years:**\n\n*   I am unable to verify the publication date of this paper. However, the references cited within the paper would be a good starting point to find papers from the last 2 years. For example, the related work section mentions different robustness of vision transformer papers. These papers could also give leads to other relevant, more recent papers."

      "summary": "Okay, I will extract the relevant information from the paper to answer the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the information, focusing on trends and relevant techniques, as presented in the paper:\n\n**Overall Trend:**\n\n*   The paper highlights a trend of **Vision Transformers (ViTs) emerging as a promising alternative to CNNs** in image classification. However, while CNNs have been extensively studied in the context of adversarial attacks, ViTs have not received the same level of scrutiny. This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of ViTs.\n\n**Key Findings and Trends Related to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n1.  **Vulnerability to White-Box Attacks:**\n    *   The paper demonstrates that **ViTs, like CNNs, are vulnerable to white-box adversarial attacks**. Six standard white-box attacks (FGSM, PGD, BPDA, MIM, C&W, APGD) were used. The results indicated that ViTs don't inherently provide better security against white-box adversaries compared to CNNs (specifically, ResNets) or Big Transfer Models (BiT-M).\n    *   Specific results: ViTs showed 0% robustness against C&W and APGD attacks, and less than 6% robustness against PGD and MIM attacks, across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). This suggests these strong attacks are particularly effective against ViTs.\n    *   The paper emphasizes the importance of using attacks like BPDA to ensure that gradient masking is not falsely indicating robustness.\n\n2.  **Low Transferability of Adversarial Examples (Inter-Genus):**\n    *   A key finding is the **low transferability of adversarial examples *between* ViTs and CNNs (or BiT models)**.  Adversarial examples crafted to fool CNNs often *do not* readily transfer to ViTs, and vice versa.  This is described as a phenomenon occurring between model \"genusus\" (ViTs, BiTs, ResNets). Within the same genus, transferability is higher.\n    *   For instance, adversarial examples generated using BiT-M models were misclassified by ViT-L-16 less than 16% of the time across all datasets.\n    *   The paper suggests this low transferability might be leveraged for security.\n\n3.  **Ensemble Defenses (Potential, but with Caveats):**\n    *   The paper explores using ensembles of ViTs and CNNs as a defense mechanism, leveraging the low transferability.\n    *   **White-Box Attacks on Ensembles:**  A novel white-box attack, the **Self-Attention Blended Gradient Attack (SAGA)**, was developed to overcome the potential benefits of ensemble defenses.  SAGA blends gradients from both ViTs and CNNs, incorporating self-attention information from the ViTs.  SAGA demonstrates that a simple ensemble of ViTs and CNNs *is not secure* under a white-box adversary with full knowledge of the models and their parameters.\n    *   **Black-Box Defense using Ensembles:**  The paper *does* show that a simple ensemble of ViTs and BiT models can achieve **significant robustness against black-box adversarial attacks**, without sacrificing clean accuracy.  This is a major result.\n    *   Under black-box conditions (specifically, using RayS and Adaptive attacks), ensembles showed improved robustness compared to single models. For RayS, the ensemble showed up to 73% increase in robust accuracy for CIFAR-100. In CIFAR-10 Adaptive attack, the robust accuracy was 57% (26.2% improvement). This demonstrates that leveraging transferability between different model genusus is effective under a black-box adversary.\n\n4.  **Black-Box Attack Techniques and Synthetic Models:**\n    *   The paper uses the RayS attack as a query-based black-box attack.\n    *   It implements an Adaptive Black-Box Attack (a stronger version of the Papernot attack), which involves training a \"synthetic\" model. The attacker uses a percentage of the training data, query access to the defense, and the ability to train the synthetic model to generate adversarial examples.\n    *   Hyperparameter experiments with the Adaptive Black-Box Attack revealed that the choice of synthetic model *significantly* affects the robust accuracy when attacking ViTs.  Using a pre-trained ViT-B-32 as the synthetic model led to a higher attack success rate than using CNN-based synthetic models (like VGG-16).  This is a notable difference from previous findings with CNNs, where the choice of synthetic model architecture was less critical.\n    *  Using ViTs in a defense, puts the transfer based attacker at a new disadvantage.\n\n5.  **Adversarial Training:**\n\n*   The paper explores Friendly Adversarial Training (FAT) as a defense mechanism for ViTs. FAT involves training the model with less strong adversarial examples. The results indicate that the adversarial robustness of ViTs with FAT is comparable to that of ResNet-based architectures.\n\n**Key Techniques:**\n\n*   **White-box Attacks:** FGSM, PGD, BPDA, MIM, C&W, APGD\n*   **Self-Attention Blended Gradient Attack (SAGA):** A novel attack designed to break ensembles of ViTs and CNNs under white-box conditions. It combines gradients from different models and incorporates self-attention information from the ViTs.\n*   **Black-box Attacks:** RayS (query-based), Adaptive Black-Box Attack (transfer-based)\n*   **Ensemble Defenses:** Combining ViTs and CNNs/BiT models\n*   **Adversarial Training:** Friendly Adversarial Training (FAT)\n\n**In summary, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, as indicated by this paper from within the last 2 years, are:**\n\n*   An increasing focus on the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their growing popularity as an alternative to CNNs.\n*   The discovery that ViTs are vulnerable to standard white-box attacks.\n*   The identification of low transferability of adversarial examples *between* ViTs and CNNs/BiT models, potentially opening up new avenues for defense.\n*   The exploration of ensemble defenses leveraging this low transferability, with some success under black-box attack scenarios.\n*   The development of novel attacks, such as SAGA, designed specifically to overcome ensemble defenses that incorporate ViTs.\n*   The use of query-based (RayS) and transfer-based (Adaptive) black-box attacks to evaluate the robustness of ViTs and ensemble defenses.\n*   The recognition of the importance of the synthetic model architecture in transfer-based black-box attacks against ViTs.\n*   The exploration of adversarial training techniques for ViTs, such as FAT."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on adversarial robustness for image classification and specifically looking for trends within the last 2 years (though publication date of this paper itself is not available):\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper introduces a novel architecture called \"Self-Ensembling Vision Transformer (SEViT)\" to enhance the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for medical image classification.  It also proposes a method for detecting adversarial samples. The core idea is to leverage the feature representations learned by the initial blocks of a ViT, which are shown to be more resilient to adversarial perturbations compared to the later blocks.\n\n**Key Contributions related to Adversarial Robustness Trends:**\n\n*   **ViTs are Vulnerable, but with Potential:** The paper acknowledges the increasing use of ViTs in medical imaging and the findings that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, aligning with the general trend that even sophisticated models are not inherently immune. However, it also notes earlier findings suggesting ViTs might be *more* robust than CNNs, and suggesting a lower transferability of attacks between the two. This highlights an active area of research: understanding the specific vulnerabilities and strengths of ViTs in the adversarial context.\n\n*   **Exploiting Intermediate Representations:**  The core of the SEViT approach focuses on a trend of utilizing information from intermediate layers of a network to improve robustness.  The paper's central argument is that adversarial attacks disproportionately affect the later layers of a ViT, while earlier layers retain more information from the original, unperturbed image. By adding intermediate MLP classifiers to the *initial* blocks and ensembling their predictions with the final classification layer, the model becomes more resistant to adversarial attacks.  This can be seen as a move away from solely relying on the final output and towards a more distributed and robust decision-making process.\n\n*   **Self-Ensembling as a Defense:**  The proposed SEViT architecture implements a self-ensembling strategy.  Ensembling, in general, is a well-established technique for improving robustness, but this paper explores a specific form of self-ensembling within the ViT architecture.  This involves creating multiple classifiers within the same network and combining their predictions. The paper specifically mentions a random selection approach, where only a subset of the intermediate classifiers are used, as a method to improve robustness against white-box adversaries.\n\n*   **Adversarial Sample Detection:** The paper proposes a method for *detecting* adversarial samples based on the consistency (or inconsistency) of predictions made by the different classifiers within the SEViT ensemble. The idea is that for clean samples, all classifiers should largely agree, while for adversarial samples, the final ViT classifier (more susceptible to attacks) will diverge from the intermediate classifiers. This divergence is quantified using Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a threshold is used to flag potentially adversarial inputs. This points to a trend of combining robust classification with adversarial detection, creating a layered defense strategy.\n\n*   **Focus on Medical Imaging:**  The paper's explicit focus on medical imaging is relevant.  Adversarial attacks in medical contexts have particularly serious implications, as highlighted in the introduction (e.g., manipulating insurance claims, circumventing clinical trial regulations). This specialization suggests that adversarial robustness research is becoming increasingly domain-specific, with researchers tailoring defenses to the unique characteristics and requirements of different applications.\n\n**Specific Techniques Mentioned (and their relevance to trends):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** The paper mentions adversarial training as a common defense mechanism. Although the authors do not directly use it, its mentioning it is a recognition of this approach as an existing trend.\n*   **Defensive Distillation:** Mentioned as a common defense.\n*   **Adversarial Purification:** Mentioned as a common defense.\n*   **PatchVeto and Robust Self-Attention:** The paper cites these as notable approaches for defending ViTs against adversarial patch attacks. These indicate a trend towards developing defenses specifically tailored to the architecture of ViTs, rather than applying generic techniques.\n*   **Foolbox Library:** The use of Foolbox for generating attacks indicates a trend toward standardization and utilization of existing tools for research in this area.\n*   **Specific Attacks Used:** The paper tests against FGSM, BIM, PGD, AutoPGD, and C&W attacks.  These are all well-known and widely used attacks in the adversarial literature, indicating that the paper is evaluating its defense against established benchmarks.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions (suggesting future trends):**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges the need to evaluate SEViT against Transformer-based attacks and under a full white-box setting. This suggests a future trend of developing more sophisticated attacks that are specifically designed to exploit the vulnerabilities of ViTs and SEViT-like architectures.\n*   The authors also plan to evaluate SEViT in the context of natural images. This suggests a trend of generalizing adversarial defenses across different domains (medical vs. natural images).\n\n**In summary, based on this paper, recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification include:**\n\n1.  **Increased Focus on Vision Transformers (ViTs):**  Moving beyond CNNs, researchers are actively investigating the adversarial vulnerabilities and defenses for ViTs.\n2.  **Exploiting Intermediate Representations:**  Leveraging feature representations from intermediate layers of neural networks to improve robustness.\n3.  **Self-Ensembling Techniques:** Utilizing self-ensembling methods within specific architectures like ViTs.\n4.  **Adversarial Sample Detection:** Combining robust classification with mechanisms to detect adversarial inputs.\n5.  **Domain-Specific Defenses:** Tailoring defenses to the specific characteristics and requirements of different applications (e.g., medical imaging).\n6.  **Development of ViT-Specific Defenses:** Developing defense mechanisms that are specifically tailored to the ViT architecture.\n7.  **Emphasis on White-Box Attacks:** Increased consideration of defenses against attackers with complete knowledge of the model.\n\nIt's important to note that this information is extracted from a *single* paper. A comprehensive overview of the latest trends would require analyzing a larger collection of recent publications. The absence of specific dates in the provided paper makes it impossible to determine if the findings fall strictly within the last 2 years, but based on the mentioned references, the paper is likely published recently."

These attacks introduce small, often imperceptible, perturbations to images that cause misclassification, which can have serious safety implications.\n*   **Proposed Solution (AR-GAN):** The paper introduces a novel defense method called \"AR-GAN\" (Attack-Resilient GAN). Key aspects:\n    *   **GAN-Based Defense:** Uses a GAN to denoise images by reconstruction. A generator reconstructs the input image, and a classifier then classifies the reconstructed image.\n    *   **Zero-Knowledge Assumption:** AR-GAN is designed to work effectively *without* prior knowledge of the specific adversarial attack being used.

The idea is to map adversarial examples back to the manifold of clean, unperturbed images.\n2.  **White-Box Attack Focus:** There's an increasing focus on developing defenses that are robust against white-box attacks, where the attacker has complete knowledge of the system.  This is considered a more realistic threat model in many scenarios.\n3.  **Robustness to Varying Perturbation Strengths:**  Defenses are moving beyond simply detecting or mitigating *any* adversarial attack to maintaining performance even as the magnitude of the perturbation increases.\n4.  **Real-World Data:**  The use of the LISA traffic sign dataset indicates a move towards evaluating defenses on more realistic, real-world data rather than just benchmark datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10.\n5.  **WGAN-GP for Stable GAN Training:** The use of WGAN-GP is a reflection of the ongoing effort to stabilize GAN training and make them more reliable for practical applications.\n6.  **End-to-End Optimization:** The AR-GAN framework emphasizes optimizing both the GAN (generator) and the classifier together, rather than treating them as separate components.\n7.  **Computational Considerations:** The paper acknowledges the importance of computational feasibility for real-world deployment in AVs and discusses the capacity of modern in-vehicle computing units.\n\nIn summary, this paper contributes to the trend of using GANs to enhance adversarial robustness in image classification, particularly in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. It emphasizes resilience against strong, white-box attacks and the importance of real-world data and computational feasibility."

      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided paper to extract information relevant to your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant content and how it addresses your question:\n\n**1. Focus of the Paper and Relevance to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   **Primary Focus:** This paper does *not* directly address *adversarial robustness* for *image classification*.  Instead, it focuses on *adversarial attacks* against *object detection* systems, specifically *black-box attacks*.\n*   **Indirect Relevance:** While the paper doesn't improve robustness, it *contributes to the field of adversarial machine learning* by exploring vulnerabilities.  Understanding attack methods is crucial for developing robust systems.  However, the paper's contributions are specific to object detection.\n\n**2. Latest Trends Addressed (Indirectly, through attack methods):**\n\nThe paper discusses and builds upon some recent trends in adversarial attacks, although again, these are applied to *object detection*, not image classification:\n\n*   **Query-based Black-box Attacks:** The paper focuses on this type of attack, which is a major trend in adversarial research.  The attacker has no knowledge of the model's internal parameters (weights, gradients) and can only query the model with inputs and observe the outputs (predicted bounding boxes and confidence scores in this case).\n*   **Transfer-based Attacks:** The paper mentions transfer-based attacks as a related area. In these attacks, adversarial examples crafted on one model (a \"surrogate\" model) are used to attack a different, target model. The paper acknowledges this as a common approach in black-box settings, and it is related to the \"transferability\" experiments the authors run.\n*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** The authors mention that dimensionality reduction has been shown to be effective to improve the efficiency of black-box attacking against image classification. The paper leverages detector's prior information to reduce the random search space.\n\n**3. Specific Techniques and Algorithms Mentioned and Used:**\n\nThe paper mentions and compares its proposed method (Parallel Rectangle Flip Attack - PRFA) to several existing attack methods. These provide insights into the current landscape of adversarial attacks (though applied to object detection):\n\n*   **ZOO (Zeroth Order Optimization):** A classic query-based black-box attack method that estimates the gradient of the target model using zeroth-order optimization. \\[9]\n*   **ZO-SignSGD:**  Extends the SignSGD optimization algorithm to the zero-order (black-box) case. \\[34]\n*   **SignHunter:** Aims to accelerate convergence by combining previous query results and converting gradient estimation to a binary problem. \\[1]\n*   **SquareAttack:** A query-efficient black-box attack that generates square-shaped perturbations at random positions. The proposed method (PRFA) uses it as a baseline. \\[2]\n*   **NES (Natural Evolution Strategies):** A black-box optimization technique used for adversarial attacks. \\[21]\n*   **Sign Flip attack:** Search the perturbation by gradually shrinking the \u2113\u221e-ball around the benign example and randomly flipping the signs of a few dimensions of the current perturbation. [10]\n\n**4. Details of the Proposed Attack (PRFA):**\n\nWhile not directly relevant to *robustness*, understanding the attack helps inform potential defenses:\n\n*   **Parallel Rectangle Flip Attack (PRFA):** This is the core contribution of the paper. It's a query-based black-box attack designed specifically for object detection. Key aspects:\n    *   **Rectangle Perturbations:** Generates perturbations in rectangular patches.\n    *   **Sign Flipping:** Flips the sign of perturbations within the rectangle to increase diversity and potentially disrupt object detection.\n    *   **Parallel Search:** Attacks multiple rectangles simultaneously to improve efficiency.\n    *   **Prior Information:** Uses prior information about object location to reduce the search space.\n\n**5. Key Takeaways and Limitations for Your Research Question:**\n\n*   **Not Directly Applicable:** This paper is primarily about attacking *object detection*, not *image classification*. Therefore, the specific techniques and results aren't directly transferable to your research question.\n*   **Insights into Black-Box Attacks:** The paper provides valuable context on current trends in black-box attacks, which *is* relevant to understanding adversarial robustness in general. The mention of query-based attacks, transfer-based attacks, and zeroth-order optimization methods are all pertinent.\n*   **Importance of Evaluation:** The paper stresses the importance of evaluating adversarial attacks, which is essential for understanding and improving robustness.\n*   **Recent References:** The paper cites several papers published in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, which is important to note with respect to your recency requirement.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper is valuable as background reading on adversarial attacks, particularly in the black-box setting. However, it doesn't directly address *adversarial robustness* for *image classification*. You would need to look at other papers that explicitly focus on *defending against* these types of attacks in image classification to fully answer your research question. The references within this paper could be a good starting point for finding such research. Also, note that many of the approaches used here could be adapted to the image classification case."

      "relevancy": "This paper was published in 2022, making it within the last 2 years. It introduces a black-box adversarial attack method using evolutionary art, which is a novel approach and thus relevant to understanding the latest trends in the field.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information from the paper that's relevant to your research question, focusing on the last 2 years (since the paper doesn't explicitly state publication date, I'm considering the \"last 2 years\" relative to the references it cites, with a cut-off of papers published after early 2022, assuming the paper was written in 2024).\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper introduces \"Art-Attack,\" a black-box adversarial attack method for image classification that uses an evolutionary art approach. It generates adversarial examples by iteratively evolving overlapping transparent shapes (circles, triangles, rectangles) placed on an image. The attack is gradient-free, meaning it doesn't require access to the target model's gradients. It only queries the model and observes the predicted class probabilities.\n*   The authors evaluate their method against state-of-the-art image classification models trained on CIFAR-10.\n*   The research explores the impact of the number and type of shapes on attack performance and compares Art-Attack to other black-box attack algorithms.\n\n**Relevance to \"Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness for Image Classification\" (Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe paper directly contributes to understanding recent trends in *black-box* adversarial attacks, a subfield of adversarial robustness. Here's what the paper suggests about these trends:\n\n1.  **Gradient-Free Attacks:**\n\n    *   A significant trend involves *gradient-free* methods.  The paper positions Art-Attack within this trend, explicitly contrasting it with white-box attacks that rely on gradient information.\n    *   It notes that many black-box attacks avoid gradient estimation due to the high dimensionality of image data, which makes estimation computationally expensive and requires many queries.\n\n2.  **Evolutionary Algorithms and Random Search:**\n\n    *   The paper highlights the use of evolutionary algorithms and random search as a common approach within gradient-free attacks, and this is the core method Art-Attack employs.  This implies a shift away from gradient estimation towards more direct search-based optimization.\n    *   Evolutionary strategies and genetic operators are used to evolve adversarial images, adapting parameters and using techniques like bilinear interpolation to manage dimensionality.\n\n3.  **Query Efficiency:**\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes *query efficiency* as a critical concern. Black-box attacks are often limited by the number of queries they can make to the target model. Art-Attack claims to achieve better success rates *and* use fewer queries than other methods.\n    *   The paper identifies query efficiency as a limitation of finite-difference methods for gradient estimation, prompting the use of dimension reduction techniques.\n\n4.  **Structured Perturbations:**\n\n    *   Most black-box attacks aim to optimize every pixel, but this paper proposes a novel approach using structured perturbations: overlapping transparent shapes.\n    *   The paper's parameter study (varying the shape type and number) suggests that the *structure* of the perturbation matters. The results indicate adversarial examples with noise concentrated in local patches can be particularly effective.\n\n5.  **Comparison with Peer Algorithms:**\n\n    *   The paper benchmarks Art-Attack against established black-box methods:\n        *   **GenAttack:**  A population-based algorithm that evolves adversarial solutions.\n        *   **Ilyas18:**  A black-box attack method that, like GenAttack, uses an embedding space and bilinear interpolation to handle dimensionality.\n        *   **AutoZoom:**  An attack that incrementally increases search bounds to find adversarial examples, then reduces the perturbation constraint.\n        *   **One-Pixel Attack:**  A method that selects a few pixels and modifies their values to cause misclassification.\n\n6.  **Threat Model:**\n\n    *   The paper formulates a threat model where the attacker only has access to the predicted probabilities from the target model by querying it with adversarial images.\n    *   The paper uses the same optimization problem as GenAttack, maximizing the target class probability while minimizing the probabilities of other classes.\n\n**Specific Findings & Claims Relevant to Trends:**\n\n*   **Art-Attack's Performance:**  The paper claims that Art-Attack outperforms GenAttack and Ilyas18, generating adversarial examples with fewer queries. It suggests that even the worst-performing Art-Attack configurations are better than these peer algorithms.\n\n*   **Limitations of Other Methods:**\n    *   **AutoZoom:**  While AutoZoom achieves a 100% success rate in finding adversarial examples, it fails to satisfy a strict constraint on the perturbation size, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and perturbation magnitude. This could point to a trend in focusing on attacks that generate smaller, more imperceptible perturbations.\n\n**Areas for Future Research (Indicative of Trends):**\n\n*   **Partial Information and Label-Only Settings:**  The authors plan to adapt Art-Attack to settings where even less information is available from the target model (e.g., only probabilities of top *k* classes or just the predicted label). This indicates a trend towards attacking more restricted, real-world scenarios.\n\n*   **Evaluation on Strong Defenses:**  The authors acknowledge the need to test Art-Attack on models with state-of-the-art defenses and larger datasets. This suggests a trend towards evaluating attacks against more robust and realistic models.\n\n**In summary:** This paper fits into the trend of researching black-box adversarial attacks, particularly those that are gradient-free, query-efficient, and capable of generating effective adversarial examples even with limited information about the target model. The use of structured perturbations (shapes) and the analysis of their impact is a novel aspect of this research."

It extends pixel attacks to object detection.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness Trends (Image Classification):**\n\n*   **Pixel-Based Attacks:** The paper directly addresses the trend of focusing on pixel-level adversarial attacks.  Traditional attacks often involve larger perturbations, making them more detectable. Pixel attacks aim to achieve misclassification with minimal changes, increasing stealth and posing a greater threat. The paper highlights a move towards more efficient and effective pixel attacks.\n*   **Query-Based Black-Box Attacks:** The research specifically focuses on the black-box setting, where the attacker has limited or no knowledge of the target model's architecture or parameters. This reflects a trend towards more realistic attack scenarios. Within black-box attacks, the paper concentrates on *query-based* methods, meaning the attacker relies on querying the model with slightly modified inputs to observe the outputs and guide the attack.  The paper notes that query-based attacks, while often more successful than transfer-based attacks, are query-intensive, thus driving a trend to reduce query numbers.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Attack Optimization:** The paper uses reinforcement learning to optimize the pixel selection and perturbation process. This reflects a trend of leveraging RL to find more effective attack strategies in a black-box setting. RL allows the attack to learn which pixels are most vulnerable and how to modify them to maximize the attack success rate.\n*   **\"Remember and Forget\" Mechanism:**  The core innovation, the Remember and Forget process, aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the RL-based attack. This novel approach directly attempts to avoid common vulnerabilities, prevent overfitting, and better explore the adversarial space.\n*   **Performance Improvement:** The paper claims state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet-1K, specifically an improvement in attack success rate, reduction in number of queries, and reduction in the modified L0 norm (number of pixels changed) compared to existing query-based pixel attacks like OnePixel, ScratchThat, and PIXLE.

Memory stores the highest reward and associated image.\n    *   **Forget Process:** Resets the RL agent and memory when rewards converge, forcing the agent to explore new areas of the image and preventing overfitting.\n*   **Problem Formalization:**  Mathematical definitions are provided for both image classification and object detection attacks, clearly defining the objective to minimize pixel perturbations while achieving misclassification or object removal.\n*   **Reward Function:**  A carefully designed reward function guides the RL agent, considering both the decrease in confidence score and the number of removed objects (or successful misclassifications).\n*   **Experimental Evaluation:**  The paper provides thorough experimental results on ImageNet-1K for image classification, comparing RFPAR to OnePixel, ScratchThat, and PIXLE across various victim models (VIT, ResNeXt50, RegNetX-32GF, DenseNet161, MNASNet, MobileNet-V3). Key metrics include success rate, L0 norm, and the number of queries.\n\n**Key Results:**\n\n*   RFPAR consistently achieves the highest success rate across all victim models on ImageNet-1K.\n*   RFPAR achieves a competitive L0 norm (number of pixels modified) compared to other methods, indicating efficiency in perturbation.\n*   RFPAR requires fewer queries than other methods (except OnePixel in some cases), demonstrating improved query efficiency.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that pixel values are limited to zero or one, which can make them noticeable in certain cases.\n*   The Forget process is described as \"quite simple,\" suggesting room for improvement.\n*   The paper discusses the potential to apply meta-learning to the Forget process to further reduce L0 and L\u221e norms.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper demonstrates a trend toward more sophisticated and efficient adversarial attacks for image classification by:\n1.

General Overview of Trends**\n\n*   **Federated Learning (FL) and Adversarial Examples:** The paper highlights a growing concern: FL models, like centralized machine learning models, are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs).  This vulnerability poses a significant threat to the secure deployment of FL models in real-world applications.\n*   **Non-IID Data Exacerbates the Problem:** The inherent non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution across clients in FL makes it even more challenging to achieve both adversarial robustness and high natural accuracy.\n*   **Various Defense Strategies Being Explored:**\n    *   **Robustness Sharing:** High-resource clients conduct adversarial training (AT) and share the resulting robustness with low-resource clients.\n    *   **Logit Adjustment:**  Re-weighting the logits of adversarially trained models to improve their robustness.\n    *   **Feature Sharing:** Boosting the resilience of FL models against attacks by contrasting adversarial features with clean ones.\n*   **Knowledge Distillation (KD):**  Leveraging a robust teacher model to produce student models with higher robust accuracy and natural accuracy.

      "summary": "Okay, I have carefully reviewed the provided research paper, \"KRUM FEDERATED CHAIN (KFC): USING BLOCKCHAIN TO DEFEND AGAINST ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS IN FEDERATED LEARNING,\" and extracted information relevant to the research question:  **What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.**\n\n**Please note:** This paper itself doesn't directly *survey* the latest trends.  Instead, it *proposes* a defense mechanism.  However, it provides context and comparisons that help understand the current landscape.  Also, since the paper itself is likely from the last 2 years, the information *within* it would also be relatively recent.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the relevant information, organized for clarity:\n\n**1. General Trends in Adversarial Robustness in Federated Learning (FL) for Image Classification (as indicated by the paper):**\n\n*   **Focus on Decentralized Defenses:** The paper highlights a growing interest in addressing the vulnerability of Federated Learning systems to adversarial attacks due to their decentralized nature (Introduction, Section 1).  This is because the server can't directly inspect client-side training data, making the system vulnerable (Section 2.3).  The trend involves designing defenses specifically suited to the distributed nature of FL.\n*   **Blockchain Integration:** A significant trend is the use of blockchain technology to enhance security and integrity in FL (Introduction, Section 1, Section 2.4).  The paper explores the potential of blockchain's immutable and transparent ledger to detect and prevent adversarial attacks in FL (Section 1).\n*   **Defense Against Specific Attack Types:** Research focuses on defending against prevalent attacks like Byzantine attacks (Introduction, Section 1, Section 2.3.1) and Backdoor attacks (Introduction, Section 1, Section 2.3.2). These attacks are commonly used to target FL systems.\n*   **Importance of Model Aggregation Strategies:** The paper emphasizes the importance of robust model aggregation techniques to mitigate the impact of malicious updates (Introduction, Section 1, Section 4). Methods like Krum (Section 4) and Trimmed-mean (Section 1, Section 5.6) are being explored.\n*   **Emphasis on Byzantine Tolerance:** A key area is Byzantine-robustness. The goal is to ensure that the system remains functional and accurate even when some participants (clients) are malicious or faulty (Section 1, Section 2.3.1).\n*   **Addressing Backdoor Attacks:** Backdoor attacks are recognized as a major threat. Research explores methods to prevent adversaries from injecting hidden malicious functionalities into the global model (Section 1, Section 2.3.2). These attacks aim to manipulate the model to perform a specific, undesirable task when triggered by a certain input (Section 2.3.2).\n\n**2. Specific Defense Mechanisms and Trends Mentioned (and Evaluated) in the Paper:**\n\n*   **Proof of Federated Learning (PoFL):**  PoFL is highlighted as a consensus mechanism designed specifically for Federated Learning, focusing on energy efficiency (Section 1, Section 3, Section 5.6). It's inspired by Proof-of-Useful-Work, aiming to use computational resources for training the FL model instead of wasteful tasks (Section 3). The paper tests PoFL's effectiveness as a defense against Byzantine and backdoor attacks.\n    *   **Pooled Mining:** This paper mentions that PoFL leverages a decoupled pooled-mining architecture (Section 3).\n*   **Krum Aggregation:**  Krum is used to enhance resilience against attacks (Section 4). It selects model updates closest to the majority, effectively filtering out outliers (Section 4). This paper proposes a novel defense strategy combining Krum and PoFL, called Krum Federated Chain (KFC) (Section 1).\n*   **Trimmed Mean:**  It utilizes the trimmed mean operator, a statistical method that excludes a specified percentage of the most extreme data points from the calculation of the mean (Section 5.6).\n*   **Federated Averaging (FedAvg):** This paper mentions that it is often considered as the default aggregation operator for FL and the most studied in literature (Section 5.6).\n*   **Model Replacement Techniques:** The paper acknowledges that attackers often use model replacement techniques to amplify the impact of their attacks and avoid mitigation (Section 2.3.3).\n\n**3. Attack Types and Scenarios Considered (Reflecting Current Concerns):**\n\n*   **Byzantine Attacks (specifically, Label-Flipping):** Untargeted attacks aimed at degrading overall model performance (Section 2.3.1, Section 5.2).  The paper uses label-flipping as a specific example (Section 5.2, Figure 3).\n*   **Backdoor Attacks (specifically, Pattern-Key):** Targeted attacks that inject a secondary task (backdoor) into the model (Section 2.3.2, Section 5.3).  The paper focuses on pattern-key backdoor attacks, where specific patterns trigger the backdoor (Section 5.3, Figure 4). The paper also mentions the alternative input-instance-key attacks (Section 2.3.2).\n*   **Attack Scenarios:** The paper tests defenses under different attack scenarios to evaluate robustness:\n    *   **Single Attacker:**  Only one client is malicious (Section 1, Section 5.4).\n    *   **Multiple Attackers:**  All miners are compromised (Section 1, Section 5.4). This is a more challenging scenario.\n\n**4. Experimental Setup (Datasets and Evaluation):**\n\n*   **Datasets:** The paper evaluates defenses on common image classification datasets: EMNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 (Section 1, Section 5.1).  These are standard benchmarks for image classification tasks.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:**  Accuracy on both the original task and the backdoor task is used to evaluate the effectiveness of defenses (Section 5.5). The metrics `accuracy` and `accuracy10` are used for evaluations (Section 5.5).\n\n**5. Key Findings (Indicating the State-of-the-Art):**\n\n*   PoFL can defend against Byzantine and backdoor attacks when only one miner is attacked (Section 6.1, Section 9).\n*   PoFL is vulnerable when all miners are attacked (Section 6.2, Section 9).\n*   KFC (Krum Federated Chain) is able to defend against adversarial attacks even when all miners are attacked (Section 7.2, Section 9).\n\n**In summary:**  The paper highlights recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within Federated Learning, including the integration of blockchain, the use of robust aggregation methods, and a focus on defending against Byzantine and backdoor attacks. It proposes and evaluates a new defense mechanism, KFC, built upon these trends, which aims to improve robustness, especially in scenarios where multiple participants are compromised."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Relevance Assessment:**\n\nThe paper primarily deals with *backdoor attacks* on Federated Generative Adversarial Networks (FedGANs) used for medical image synthesis, *not directly with adversarial robustness for image classification*. While it touches upon defense strategies relevant to the *generative* setting, its focus is on poisoning attacks *during the training of a GAN* rather than defending a *trained classifier* against adversarial examples. That said, there is some value here, since there can be overlap of techniques between the fields.\n\n**Key Information Extracted (and relevance to the research question):**\n\n1.  **Context and Problem:**\n    *   The paper addresses the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) to backdoor attacks, specifically within the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) used for medical image synthesis.\n    *   In a backdoor attack, malicious clients in FL can poison training data by adding a \"trigger\" (e.g., a small patch) to images and mislabeling them.\n    *   The goal in this paper is to corrupt the server's generator in the FedGAN, such that it no longer generates realistic medical images.\n    *   Existing backdoor attacks mainly target classification models. This paper focuses on backdoor attacks in the federated GAN setting.\n\n2.  **Attack Methodology:**\n    *   The attack involves poisoning the training data of the local *discriminators* in the FedGAN.\n    *   A small trigger (16x16 pixels, 0.39% of the original image size) is added to the bottom right of all training images in the malicious client's dataset.\n    *   The authors hypothesize that local discriminators overfit on the poisoned data, disrupting the GAN equilibrium and corrupting the global generator.\n\n3.  **Defense Strategies (Relevant to Robustness):**\n    *   The paper proposes two defense strategies:\n        *   **Global Malicious Detection:**  This is a server-side technique where clients upload their generator loss along with model parameters.  Isolation Forest is used to detect outlier loss values, identifying potentially malicious clients.  Clients flagged as malicious have their aggregation weight reduced.\n        *   **Local Training Regularization:** This involves modifying the local training procedure for each client to make it more robust. The paper specifically suggests replacing the vanilla GAN loss with Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to regularize the discriminator training.  RMSProp is used instead of Adam.\n\n4.  **Experimental Setup:**\n    *   The FedGAN is trained on the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset (skin cancer images).\n    *   A StyleGAN2-ADA generator and a DCGAN discriminator are used.\n    *   The FL setup consists of four clients, with one client being malicious.\n    *   Metrics used to evaluate the generated images include Inception Score (IS), Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), and Kernel Inception Distance (KID).\n\n5.  **Results:**\n    *   The backdoor attack is shown to effectively corrupt the generated images.\n    *   The combination of global malicious detection and local training regularization (WGAN-GP) significantly improves the quality of generated images under attack.\n    *   Local training regularization alone helps alleviate the attack, but doesn't fully resolve it.\n    *   Global malicious detection blocks adversarial behavior but performs worse than the full defense.\n\n6.  **Relevant References (within the last 2 years - 2022-2024):**\n    *   While most references cited are older, here are the ones that fall within the last 2 years:\n      *  Guo, W., Tondi, B., Barni, M.: An overview of backdoor attacks against deep neural networks and possible defences. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.08429 (2021)\n      *  Huang, Y., et al.: Evaluating gradient inversion attacks and defenses in federated learning. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34, 7232\u20137241 (2021)\n      *  Ozdayi, M.S., Kantarcioglu, M., Gel, Y.R.: Defending against backdoors in federated learning with robust learning rate. In: Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. vol. 35, pp. 9268\u20139276 (2021)\n\n**How this relates to \"adversarial robustness for *image classification*\":**\n\n*   **Defense Techniques Overlap:** The local training regularization strategy (using WGAN-GP) shares some conceptual similarity with techniques used in adversarial training for classifiers.  WGAN-GP aims to stabilize the GAN training process, which, in this context, translates to making the discriminator less susceptible to being \"fooled\" by the trigger. Robustness in classification aims to avoid \"fooling\" the classifier with adversarial perturbations.\n*   **Backdoor Attacks as a Threat Model:** The concept of backdoor attacks is relevant to the broader field of adversarial machine learning. Backdoors represent a specific type of vulnerability where the model's behavior can be manipulated through carefully crafted inputs or data poisoning.\n*   **Federated Learning Context:**  FL presents unique challenges for adversarial robustness due to the distributed nature of the data and the potential for malicious participants.\n\n**Limitations of Relevance:**\n\n*   The paper's focus is on *generative models* (GANs), not classifiers.  The attack target is the *generator*, not a classifier.\n*   The defense strategies are tailored to the GAN training process.\n\n**In summary:** While the paper is not a direct study of adversarial robustness for image *classification*, it provides insights into backdoor attacks and defense strategies within the related domain of federated GANs. The defense techniques, particularly local training regularization, have conceptual links to adversarial training methods, and the federated learning context is relevant to the broader challenges of building robust machine learning systems in distributed environments. It's important to recognize the difference in focus \u2013 this is about *generating robust images* (i.e., preventing a backdoor from being embedded in the generator) rather than *classifying images robustly* (i.e., defending a trained classifier against adversarial examples)."

Specific Adversarial Attacks Considered (and Trends in the Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe paper highlights several types of adversarial attacks relevant to FL, many of which have been explored in the last two years:\n\n*   **Data Poisoning Attacks:** This involves injecting malicious or manipulated data into the training dataset to degrade the model's performance or cause it to misclassify specific inputs. The paper specifically examines the impact of watermarked samples as a form of data poisoning.\n*   **Model Poisoning Attacks:**  Attackers manipulate the model updates sent to the central server (in centralized FL) or shared with other participants (in decentralized FL).\n*   **Backdoor Attacks:**  These attacks aim to implant a hidden trigger into the model. When the trigger is present in an input, the model will misclassify it in a specific way, even if it correctly classifies other inputs.\n*   **Gradient Poisoning Attacks:** The attacker manipulates the gradients sent during the training process to corrupt the global model. The paper looks into scenarios where gradients are reversed or nullified.\n*   **Privacy Attacks:** While not directly related to adversarial robustness in terms of misclassification, the table includes privacy attacks, reflecting a growing concern about data leakage in FL. Examples include data leakage in VFL.\n\n**3.

It explicitly shows the types of attacks analyzed in conjunction with VFL and HFL.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the entries from 2022-2023 (as the question explicitly asks):\n\n*   **[23] 2022:** VFL, Decentralized, Privacy and Model Poisoning\n*   **[24] 2022:** VFL, Decentralized, Privacy Attack\n*   **[25] 2022:** VFL, Centralized, Label Flipping, Gradient and Model Poisoning\n*   **[26] 2022:** VFL, Centralized, Data and Model Poisoning\n\nBased on these entries, some notable trends are:\n\n    *   **Focus on VFL:** The majority of the listed works in 2022 focus on Vertical Federated Learning (VFL).  This suggests increased attention to the unique challenges of VFL in adversarial settings.\n    *   **Model and Data Poisoning:** Model and data poisoning remain a relevant threat vector.\n    *   **Privacy Attacks:** Several entries highlight privacy attacks.\n    *   **Centralized and Decentralized:** Works address both centralized and decentralized aggregation methods.\n\n**4. Experimental Results and Findings:**\n\n*   The paper's experiments reveal the vulnerability of HFL and VFL architectures to data poisoning and gradient poisoning attacks.\n*   **Data Poisoning:** Injecting even a small percentage of watermarked samples can significantly degrade the model's performance on watermarked data.\n*   **Gradient Poisoning:** Manipulating gradients (e.g., reversing them) can severely impact model accuracy, especially in the VertiComb architecture.\n*   The HoriChain architecture appears more resilient to gradient poisoning than VertiComb in some scenarios.\n\n**5. Architectures:**\n\nThe paper proposes three architectures: HoriChain, VertiChain and VertiComb. HoriChain and VertiComb architectures achieve >95% accuracy with the train and test sets in the absence of attacks.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe paper indicates that adversarial robustness in federated learning, especially in VFL, is an active area of research.  Recent trends involve:\n\n*   A continued focus on data and model poisoning attacks.\n*   Growing concerns and research into privacy attacks within federated learning settings.\n*   Analysis of both centralized and decentralized federated learning aggregation methods in the context of adversarial attacks.\n*   Evaluation of the effectiveness of gradient manipulation attacks.\n\nThe paper's experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of federated learning models to these attacks, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms."

      "summary": "Okay, let's analyze the provided paper (\"Using adversarial images to improve outcomes of federated learning for non-IID data\") to extract information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the paper's content and its relevance, focusing on the past two years:\n\n**1. Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on using adversarial images to improve the performance of Federated Learning (FL) in non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data scenarios. Specifically, it addresses the problem of label distribution skew in FL.\n*   It proposes a novel method called Adversarial Federated Learning (AdFL).  AdFL leverages the transferability of adversarial inputs to improve the quality of FL, focusing on using them to measure \"cohesion\" among federated clients.\n\n**2. Relevance to Adversarial Robustness Trends (Within the Last 2 Years):**\n\n*   **Indirectly Relevant:** The paper does *not* directly address adversarial robustness *as a defense mechanism* in image classification in general. Instead, it *uses* adversarial examples as a tool within a federated learning framework to improve performance on non-IID data.  The underlying assumption is that adversarial examples can reveal information about the model's decision boundary and transfer learned information, but it doesn't explore how to make models *more robust* against adversarial attacks directly.\n\n*   **Techniques Used and Referenced (Regarding Adversarial Attacks):**  The paper utilizes and mentions some techniques that are related to adversarial robustness research:\n\n    *   **I-FGSM (Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method):** The paper uses I-FGSM to generate adversarial examples. FGSM and its iterative variants are fundamental methods in adversarial attack research. While the paper *uses* this method, it doesn't present novel modifications or improvements to FGSM itself.\n\n    *   **Transferability of Adversarial Examples:** The paper explicitly relies on the transferability property, where adversarial examples generated on one model can fool another.  This is a crucial concept in adversarial robustness, as it shows that attacks can generalize across different models, architectures, and datasets.  The paper uses this property to measure \"cohesion\" among federated clients.\n\n    *   **Weighted Federated Averaging (WFedAvg):** The paper's novelty lies in using adversarial examples to define weights for clients in WFedAvg, rather than using them for direct adversarial training to improve robustness.\n\n*   **Citations Within the Last 2 Years:** The paper cites several works from the last two years (2021-2022) related to adversarial attacks and federated learning:\n    *   Li, Y., Cheng, M., Hsieh, C.J., Lee, T.C.M.: A review of adversarial attack and defense for classification methods.

(2021)\n\n    These citations suggest awareness of the current research landscape.\n**3. Specific Relevant Information:**\n\n*   **AdFL Algorithm's Use of Adversarial Examples:** The core idea is to generate adversarial images *on the server-side* using the model parameters received from clients. These adversarial images are then used to evaluate the \"cohesion\" or agreement between different client models. The more a client's model can predict adversarial examples generated by other clients, the higher its weight in the federated averaging process.\n\n*   **Algorithm Steps:**\n\n    1.  Clients train on local data and send model updates to the server.\n    2.  The server recreates local models for each client.\n    3.  The server generates adversarial images for each label, using an iterative version of FGSM.\n    4.  Each client model predicts the adversarial inputs generated by all models.\n    5.  Clients receive weights based on their ability to predict adversarial inputs produced by other models.\n    6.  A weighted version of FedAvg (WFedAvg) is used to generate a global model.\n\n*   **Weight Calculation:** The weight assigned to each client is based on:\n\n    *   How well the client recognizes adversarial images generated by other models.\n    *   How well the adversarial images produced by the client are recognized by other models.\n\n**4. Limitations and Future Work (from the perspective of answering the research question):**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that more complex datasets and larger-scale experiments are needed.  It also mentions the need to investigate cases where adversarial inputs fail to transfer, which is directly relevant to understanding the limitations of transferability in adversarial robustness.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWhile this paper is not directly about improving adversarial robustness as a defense mechanism, it leverages adversarial examples in a novel way within a federated learning setting. It demonstrates how adversarial examples can be used to measure the similarity and agreement between models in a distributed environment, which implicitly touches upon the concept of model robustness. It uses well-established adversarial attack techniques (I-FGSM) and the principle of transferability. Its citations indicate awareness of current research. The paper's focus is more on federated learning performance improvements than on direct adversarial robustness. Therefore it only provides minor insights into recent trends."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper, specifically focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last two years, along with detailed explanations:\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper investigates a specific type of attack in federated learning called \"internal evasion attacks,\" where malicious clients exploit knowledge of other clients' models to craft adversarial examples that bypass defenses.  While not directly focused on general trends in adversarial robustness for *image classification*, it *does* evaluate certain defenses *within a federated learning context*, which has some relevance. The paper emphasizes that traditional defenses like adversarial training are less effective against these internal attacks.\n\n**Key Information Related to Adversarial Robustness (Relevant even if scoped to federated learning):**\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training (and its limitations in Federated Learning):**\n\n    *   The paper acknowledges that adversarial training is a well-known and generally reliable defense against perturbation attacks (referencing Shafahi et al., 2019). It's described as a method where adversarial examples (perturbed inputs) are added to the training data, teaching the model to correctly classify these altered inputs.\n    *   Specifically, the paper references Zizzo et al. (2020) as *the first to consider utilizing adversarial training with federated learning.*  This is important because it establishes the baseline of using adversarial training in a federated setting.\n    *   *However*, a core finding of the paper is that adversarial training *alone* is not sufficient to defend against internal evasion attacks in federated learning. The rationale:  Adversaries have \"white-box\" access (full knowledge) of the victim's model, making it easier to craft effective attacks, even against adversarially trained models. Table 4 presents experimental results demonstrating this limitation (FAT achieves high robustness against *external* attacks but significantly lower robustness against *internal* attacks).\n    *   The paper argues that adversarial training alone does not provide sufficient robustness against internal attacks because the perturbations are created with respect to the gradient information of already hardened models.\n    *  The paper mentions other extensions to improve federated adversarial robustness, including randomized smoothing of models (Chen et al., 2021).\n\n2.  **Personalized Federated Learning as a Defense:**\n\n    *   The paper proposes a novel defense called \"pFedDef\" (personalized Federated Defense). This combines personalized federated learning with adversarial training. The core idea is to *reduce the shared model information* between clients, making internal attacks more difficult.\n    *   Personalized federated learning aims to create *differences between client models*, leveraging non-IID (independent and identically distributed) data distributions to improve robustness. This moves the attack scenario from a \"white-box\" to a \"grey-box\" setting, where the attacker has *limited* knowledge of the victim's model. The paper cites Marfoq et al. (2021) as the foundation for their personalized federated learning approach, FedEM. FedEM models each client's data distribution as a mixture of underlying distributions.\n    *   pFedDef *also* addresses the issue of heterogeneous client resources. Clients with more resources can propagate adversarial learning to clients with fewer resources but similar data distributions. The paper mentions that robustness propagation ideas are used by Hong et al. (2021) for FedAvg, but pFedDef allows for more fine-grained and dynamic client participation.\n    *   The authors formulate an optimization problem for adversarial robustness propagation (Equation 4) and provide a heuristic solution (Algorithm 2) to achieve the desired adversarial data set proportion globally by inducing clients with ample resources to increase their local adversarial proportions.\n    *   Experimental results (Table 4) show that pFedDef achieves higher internal robustness compared to standard federated adversarial training (\"FAT\"). It also maintains reasonable robustness against external attacks. Table 5 shows the adversarial inter-boundary distance as well as the gradient alignment metric increases for pFedDef compared to that of FedEM in Table 3, indicating that adversarial training combined with personalized learning pushes individual clients models further apart, contributing to the lower transferability of internal evasion attacks.\n    *   Figure 2 shows the effect of robustness propagation. Robustness propagation allows models to obtain higher robustness by leveraging resource availability at resource ample clients, especially improving performance when overall system resources are low.\n\n3.  **Characterizing Evasion Attack Transferability:**\n\n    *   The paper introduces the concept of \"internal evasion attacks\" and contrasts them with \"external evasion attacks.\" Internal attacks are more potent because the adversary has more information about the victim's model.\n    *   The paper highlights a \"trade-off between accuracy and robustness.\" Traditional federated learning (where all clients train a single model) can achieve high accuracy but is vulnerable to internal attacks.  Local training (where each client trains a model on its own data) is more robust but has lower accuracy. Personalized federated learning aims to bridge this gap.\n    *   The paper uses the \"inter-boundary distance\" (IBD) metric (from Tramer et al., 2017) to empirically measure the similarity of decision boundaries between models. A *lower* IBD indicates more similar models, leading to higher attack transferability. Similarly, the gradient alignment metric compares the alignment of the input gradients of the loss function computed for two models, and a lower value indicates higher alignment, leading to higher attack transferability.\n    *   Table 2 presents experimental results comparing the transferability of internal and external attacks for different training algorithms (FedAvg, Local, FedEM).\n    *   Equation 1 details the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method, a popular technique for crafting evasion attacks.\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Extended Adversarial Threats:**\n\n    *   The paper explores the effectiveness of internal evasion attacks under different types of personalization, data distribution settings, and local tuning after federated learning.\n    *   The paper also considers different adversarial models, including the combination of internal evasion attacks with ensemble attack methods and Sybil attacks.\n    *   Figure 5a analyzes robustness against internal evasion attacks with different numbers of PGD-steps used by the adversary to craft the attacks. Against FedAvg and FedEM, internal evasion attacks lower the classification accuracy as the number of attack steps are increased. FAT (FedAvg + adversarial training) and pFedDef (FedEM + adversarial training) experience lower accuracy losses, with pFedDef experiencing the least severe accuracy drop, highlighting the effectiveness of personalization against internal evasion attacks.\n    *   Figure 5b explores \"ensemble attacks,\" where multiple clients collude to generate more effective attacks. pFedDef's adversarial training defends the entire hypothesis space and dramatically improves robustness even against ensemble attacks with many adversaries.\n    *   Figure 5c evaluates robustness to a Sybil data poisoning attack. Here, adversarial training provides more exposure to perturbed and abnormal data points.\n\n**Limitations and Caveats:**\n\n*   **Federated Learning Context:** The paper's findings are primarily applicable to *federated learning* settings. While the core concepts of adversarial robustness are relevant to general image classification, the specific threat model (internal evasion attacks) is unique to federated learning.\n*   **Specific Datasets:** The experimental results are based on CIFAR-10, CelebA, and a Fake News dataset. Generalizability to other datasets is not explicitly proven.\n*   **Attack Type:** The analysis focuses mainly on gradient-based evasion attacks (PGD). While the authors suggest results should generalize, this isn't definitively shown.\n*   **Assumptions:** The FedEM-based implementation of pFedDef has specific assumptions on data distributions and can be resource-intensive.\n\n**Citations for the Last Two Years (2022-2024):**\n\n*   Kim, T., Singh, S., Madaan, N., and Joe-Wong, C.

While its direct contribution to general image classification adversarial robustness is limited, the insights into the limitations of standard adversarial training in specific scenarios and the potential of personalized approaches are valuable."

Key Components of GUARDT2I:**\n\n*   ***c\u00b7LLM (Conditional Large Language Model):*** This is the core of the framework. It's fine-tuned to \"translate\" the latent representation of the text prompt (within the T2I model) back into plain text. This reveals the real intention of the user. Architecture includes cross-attention layers. Trained using teacher forcing.\n*   ***Verbalizer:*** A module that checks if the \"Prompt Interpretation\" generated by the c\u00b7LLM contains any explicit NSFW words. It uses a developer-defined list of sensitive words.  This list is adaptable, meaning it can be updated to include new NSFW terms.\n*   ***Sentence Similarity Checker:***  This component examines the similarity between the original input prompt and the \"Prompt Interpretation\" generated by the c\u00b7LLM. If the similarity is low, the prompt is flagged as potentially malicious. It uses a pre-trained sentence similarity model (Sentence-BERT).\n\n**4. Related Work & Comparison to Existing Approaches:**\n\n*   The paper categorizes existing defense methods into:\n    *   *Training Interference:*  Techniques that remove inappropriate concepts during training (dataset filtering, fine-tuning to forget NSFW concepts).  The paper notes these can compromise image quality and are still vulnerable to attacks.\n    *   *Post-hoc Content Moderation:* Methods that use text or image classifiers to block malicious prompts or generated content (OpenAI-Moderation, SafetyChecker). The paper claims these struggle with adversarial prompts.\n\n*   GUARDT2I is presented as a *generative* approach, contrasting with the traditional *classification-based* methods.  The authors argue that a generative approach is more generalizable to various NSFW content and provides interpretability.\n*   The authors contrast GUARDT2I with several baselines, including commercial moderation APIs (OpenAI Moderation, Microsoft Azure Content Moderator, AWS Comprehend) and open-source tools (NSFW-text-classifier, Detoxify), highlighting GUARDT2I's superior performance, especially against adaptive attacks.\n\n**5. Experimental Results:**\n\n*   Evaluated on multiple adversarial prompt datasets (I2P, SneakyPrompt, Ring-A-Bell, P4D, MMA-Diffusion).\n*   GUARDT2I outperformed baselines in AUROC, AUPRC, and FPR@TPR95 (False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate). Achieves the highest average AUROC of 98.36% and the highest average AUPRC of 98.51%.\n*   The paper emphasizes that GUARDT2I has a low impact on normal use cases (low false positive rate).\n*   Also robust against adaptive attacks.\n\n**6. Adaptive Attacks:**\n\n* Adaptive attacks are preformed by modifying the most recent MMA-Diffusion adversarial attack, which provides a flexible gradient-based optimization flow to attack T2I models, by adding an additional term to attack GUARDT2I.\n* Overall \"Attack Success Rate\" is no higher than 16%, where as Safety Checker is higher than 85.48%\n* Qualitative results show that the successful adversarial prompts trend to degrade the synthesis quality, weakening the threat posed by adaptive attacks.\n\n**7. Key Novelty:**\n\n*   GUARDT2I is the first generative paradigm defensive framework specifically designed for T2I models.\n*   It provides decision-making interpretation.\n*   It proposed a conditional LLM (c\u00b7LLM) to \"translate\" the latent back to plain text, coupled with bi-level parsing methods for prompt moderation.\n\n**8. Publication Details and Implications for the Research Question:**\n\n*   The paper is to be presented at NeurIPS 2024, indicating it's a very recent contribution.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness for Image Classification):**\n\n*   **Generative Defenses:** This paper exemplifies a trend toward using generative models (specifically, large language models) within the defense mechanism itself.  Instead of just classifying inputs, the defense *interprets* the input and then moderates based on that interpretation. This is a shift from traditional classification-based defenses.\n*   **Interpretability:** There's a growing interest in making defenses more interpretable.  GUARDT2I's ability to provide a \"prompt interpretation\" is a direct attempt to address this.\n*   **Defense Against Adversarial Prompts (for Text-to-Image):** While the paper focuses on T2I models, the underlying principles (using LLMs for semantic analysis and moderation) could potentially be adapted to other image classification tasks where adversarial inputs are crafted through text or other modalities.\n*   **Adaptive Attack Resistance:** The evaluation against adaptive attacks indicates a trend toward developing defenses that are robust even when the attacker has knowledge of the defense mechanism. This is crucial for real-world deployment.\n*   **LLM Leverage**: A clear trend of using LLMs (or fine-tuned versions like c\u00b7LLM) to understand and moderate complex inputs. LLMs are being utilized to analyze the semantic intent behind the input, going beyond simple keyword filtering or pattern matching.\n\n**In summary:** This paper highlights a recent trend of using generative, interpretable defenses against adversarial attacks, specifically by leveraging the power of large language models. The focus on T2I models is somewhat specific, but the underlying principles and techniques are relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness in image classification. It indicates a move towards more sophisticated defenses that can understand and interpret complex inputs rather than relying on simple classification."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to address your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** ROBUST SENSIBLE ADVERSARIAL LEARNING OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION\n\n**Authors:** Jungeum Kim and Xiao Wang (Purdue University)\n\n**Publication Date:**  The paper is submitted to the Annals of Applied Statistics.  Since you specified \"last 2 years,\" we need to determine the relevance based on the submission date.  I'll assume this is a recent submission within the last 2 years for the purpose of this analysis.\n\n**Core Idea and Contributions:**\n\nThe paper introduces \"Sensible Adversarial Learning\" as a novel approach to improve adversarial robustness in deep neural networks (DNNs) for image classification, addressing the trade-off between robustness and standard accuracy. The key idea is to define a \"sensible adversary\" that generates adversarial examples *without* crossing the Bayes decision boundary (or, in a practical training sense, staying above a certain confidence threshold for the correct class).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key contributions, relevant to trends in adversarial robustness:\n\n1.  **Sensible Adversary Framework:** The paper proposes a framework where adversarial perturbations are constrained *not* to cross the Bayes decision boundary, adapting the perturbation ball for each data point.  This is intended to align the goals of robustness and accuracy.\n\n2.  **Theoretical Justification:** They theoretically demonstrate that the Bayes classifier is the most robust classifier under their \"sensible adversary\" framework *if* there is enough model capacity.  Specifically, if the Bayes decision boundary is sufficiently far from the data manifolds (by at least epsilon), then pursuing sensible robustness does *not* incur an adversarial robust risk.\n\n3.  **SENSE-AT Algorithm:** The paper presents a practical and efficient adversarial training (AT) algorithm called SENSE-AT (Sensible Adversarial Training) that implements the sensible adversary framework.\n\n    *   It uses a technique called \"implicit loss truncation\" to handle the challenge of training in the absence of a true Bayes classifier. The algorithm implicitly truncates the loss to prioritize natural accuracy when conditions aren't favorable for robustness.\n    *   It doesn't require additional networks or auxiliary datasets, unlike some other methods.\n    *   SENSE-AT enjoys robustness without a significant drop in natural accuracy. Furthermore, the algorithm is not sensitive to the model capacity. When insufficient model capacity is given, their algorithm does not collapse to a constant function. Instead, it trains a model as robust as possible.\n\n4.  **Empirical Validation:** The paper demonstrates empirically that SENSE-AT can stably learn both robust and accurate models on CIFAR10, achieving high natural test accuracy (over 90%) and comparable adversarial test accuracy against various attacks.\n\n**How this addresses the Research Question (Latest Trends):**\n\nThis paper touches on several current trends in adversarial robustness for image classification:\n\n*   **Addressing the Robustness-Accuracy Trade-Off:** A major trend is finding ways to mitigate the inherent trade-off between standard accuracy and robustness to adversarial examples. SENSE-AT directly addresses this by prioritizing accuracy when the conditions for robust learning are not ideal.\n*   **Adaptive Perturbation Constraints:** The concept of adapting perturbation constraints based on the data, rather than using a fixed epsilon for all inputs, is a trend in adversarial robustness. This paper proposes the idea of adapting the perturbation ball for each example such that adversarial examples would not cross the decision boundary of the Bayes classifier. This is closely related to the idea of Instance Adaptive Adversarial Training (IAAT).\n*   **Efficient Adversarial Training:** Research is focusing on developing more computationally efficient adversarial training methods.  SENSE-AT claims to be efficient by using \"implicit loss truncation\" and requiring only one forward/backward pass per data point during training.\n*   **Model Capacity Considerations:**  The paper acknowledges and attempts to address the role of model capacity in achieving robustness. They designed SENSE-AT to be more robust with limited model capacity, preventing the \"collapse\" that can occur in standard adversarial training when the model is too small.\n*   **Practicality and Implementation:** There's a trend toward developing methods that are easy to implement and use in practice. SENSE-AT is designed to be easily integrated into existing deep learning frameworks, requiring only a simple modification (the \"sensible reversion\" step) to standard PGD-based adversarial training. The code is made available.\n*   **Black-box Transferability:** This research paper includes evaluation against transfer attacks to further evaluate the adversarial robustness of the proposed method.\n\n**Related Work and Comparisons (Highlights from Section 2):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training (AT):**  The paper acknowledges AT as the most popular approach, particularly the regular AT (R-AT) method using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks (Madry et al., 2018). SENSE-AT is presented as an improvement upon R-AT.\n\n*   **Sample Complexity:** Some research focuses on sample complexity, showing that R-AT needs more data to ensure good natural performance (Schmidt et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2019).\n\n*   **Class-Changing Perturbations:** The paper mentions work that seeks to prevent class changes caused by large perturbations (Tsipras et al., 2019; Suggala et al., 2019; Stutz et al., 2019). SENSE-AT builds on this by invalidating class-changing adversarial examples and providing a practical algorithm without requiring additional networks.\n\n*   **Alternatives to R-AT:** They cite alternative AT methods that attempt to balance robustness and accuracy (Balaji et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020), and they provide a comparative study between SENSE-AT and these methods.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions:**\n\n*   The paper suggests future work includes developing generalization error bounds for sensible adversarial training and addressing the lack of sample size.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper contributes to the ongoing research in adversarial robustness for image classification by introducing a \"sensible adversarial learning\" framework and a practical algorithm (SENSE-AT). It addresses the robustness-accuracy trade-off, uses adaptive perturbation constraints, and is designed to be efficient and robust even with limited model capacity. The paper highlights the importance of accounting for model capacity when developing adversarial training methods. Also, this research has tested the proposed method with various attacks to assess its performance and transferability. This paper considers many ideas that reflect the current research."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed breakdown of the paper \"Are Vision Transformers Robust to Patch Perturbations?\" with a focus on extracting information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**High-Level Summary of the Paper:**\n\nThis paper investigates the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) compared to CNNs, specifically focusing on *patch-wise* perturbations (both natural and adversarial).  It finds that ViTs are more robust to *natural* patch corruptions but more vulnerable to *adversarial* patch perturbations. The authors attribute this to the attention mechanism in ViTs, which can be both helpful in ignoring natural corruptions and easily misled by adversarial patches.  They propose a \"Smoothed Attention\" method to improve ViT robustness against adversarial patch attacks.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness):**\n\nThis paper directly addresses adversarial robustness in image classification, focusing on Vision Transformers, which are a relatively recent and actively researched architecture. The trends it highlights are:\n\n1.  **Focus on Vision Transformers (ViTs):**  The paper itself is evidence of a trend.  The fact that the researchers are investigating the *specific* vulnerabilities and strengths of ViTs indicates that this architecture is a major focus in the field of adversarial robustness. The introduction explicitly states the rising interest in ViT robustness.  Citations [5, 20, 38, 39, 41, 42, 45] support this claim.\n\n2.  **Patch-Based Attacks and Defenses:**  The paper's core contribution is the investigation of *patch-wise* adversarial attacks. This signifies a trend beyond traditional whole-image attacks.  The authors note that patch-based attack [20, 12] and defense [32, 42] methods have been proposed recently. This shows that research is moving towards understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities at a finer granularity than the entire image. This is particularly relevant for ViTs due to their patch-based nature.\n\n3.  **Understanding the Role of Attention Mechanisms:** The paper emphasizes the importance of the *attention mechanism* in ViT's adversarial vulnerability.  This highlights a trend of going beyond simply attacking or defending models and trying to *understand* the underlying reasons for their robustness or lack thereof.  The finding that attention can be easily fooled is crucial.\n\n4.  **Architecture-Specific Defenses:** The \"Smoothed Attention\" method is an example of an *architecture-specific* defense. This indicates a trend of developing defenses tailored to the specific characteristics of the model being attacked (in this case, the attention mechanism of ViTs).\n\n5. **Hybrid Architectures:** The paper discusses the robustness of different model architectures, including CNNs, ViTs, and hybrid architectures (e.g., LeViT). This signifies a trend of exploring the trade-offs between robustness and performance in different architectures. The finding that LeViT's robustness lies somewhere between ViTs and CNNs suggests that hybrid architectures may offer a good balance between the two.\n\n6. **Swin Transformers:** The paper mentions that Swin Transformers are as robust as CNNs, which is attributed to their hierarchical attention and shifted windows. This highlights the importance of attention mechanism design for robustness and the potential for Swin Transformers to be a more robust alternative to ViTs.\n\n7. **MLP-Mixer:** The paper discusses the robustness of Mixer-MLP, which uses the same patch-based architecture as ViTs but has no attention module. The finding that Mixer-MLP is more robust than ViTs further confirms that the vulnerability of ViT can be attributed to the attention mechanism.\n\n**Specific Details Extracted from the Paper:**\n\n*   **ViT Vulnerability to Adversarial Patches:** ViTs are *more vulnerable* to adversarial patch attacks compared to ResNets (a type of CNN).  This is a key finding.\n\n*   **ViT Robustness to Natural Corruptions:** ViTs are *more robust* to naturally corrupted patches compared to ResNets. This is an interesting contrast.\n\n*   **Attention Mechanism as the Key:** The self-attention mechanism in ViTs is identified as the primary reason for both the increased robustness to natural corruptions *and* the increased vulnerability to adversarial patches. The attention mechanism can effectively ignore natural patch corruption, while it's also easy to manipulate the self-attention mechanism to focus on an adversarial patch.\n\n*   **Smoothed Attention:** A proposed defense mechanism that uses temperature scaling in the softmax operation of the attention mechanism to discourage the attention mechanism to a single patch. The results in Fig. 8 show that the robustness of ViT can be improved with Smoothed Attention.\n\n*   **Experimental Setup:** The authors carefully create a \"fair\" comparison between ViTs (specifically DeiT) and ResNets by training them with similar settings and model sizes. This emphasizes the importance of controlled experiments in adversarial robustness research.\n\n*   **Fooling Rate (FR):** The paper uses Fooling Rate as the primary evaluation metric, which is a standard metric in adversarial robustness.\n\n*   **Patch Position Sensitivity:** The paper analyzes the sensitivity of ViTs to the location of adversarial patches, finding that ViTs show similar sensitivity to different input patches regardless of the content of the image.\n\n*   **Transferability of Adversarial Patches:** The paper investigates the transferability of adversarial patches across different patch positions of the image, finding that adversarial patches transfer well when they are shifted to cover other patches exactly, but not when they are shifted by a single pixel.\n\n*   **Imperceptible Patch Attack:** The paper compares DeiT and ResNet under a setting where the adversarial perturbation is imperceptible to humans, bounded by 8/225, and finds that DeiT is still more vulnerable than ResNet.\n\n*   **Targeted Patch Attack:** The paper compares DeiT and ResNet under targeted patch attacks, which can be achieved by maximizing the probability of the target class, and finds that DeiT is still more vulnerable than ResNet.\n\n*   **ViT-Agnostic Patch Attack:** The paper studies ViT-agnostic patch attack where the adversarial patch of the same size as an input patch is placed to a random area of the image, and finds that DeiT becomes less vulnerable to adversarial patch attack, but is still more vulnerable than ResNet.\n\n**Cited Papers (Potentially Relevant, Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe reference list contains several papers published within the last two years (2020-2022) that are likely relevant to the research question.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on the last 2 years (approximately 2022-2024, given the paper's context):\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper addresses adversarial robustness in the specific context of **free-space segmentation for indoor robotic navigation.** While not strictly *image classification*, the underlying segmentation models often employ classification principles, and the adversarial attacks share similarities.\n\n**Key Ideas and Contributions (Relevant to Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training with Hidden Layer Regularization:**\n    *   The core idea is to improve adversarial robustness by not only using adversarial training (training on both clean and adversarially perturbed images) but also by adding a regularization term to the loss function.\n    *   This regularization term, called the \"adversarial hidden loss,\" minimizes the divergence between the hidden layer representations of clean and adversarial images within the neural network (specifically, the SegFormer's encoder).  The aim is to make the intermediate representations more similar, thus mitigating the effect of adversarial perturbations earlier in the network.\n    *   The total loss function becomes `ltotal = L + \u03bblh`, where `L` is the standard adversarial training loss, `lh` is the adversarial hidden loss, and `\u03bb` controls the regularization strength.\n    *   The authors hypothesize that this approach mitigates the gradual increasing effect of harmful adversarial perturbations by applying regularization techniques to intermediate network layers rather than exclusively applying supervisory signals on the network\u2019s final layers.\n    *   The paper also hypothesize that during adversarial training the model learns to generalize better and becomes less sensitive to small perturbations in input data and by incorporating losses in the hidden layers, the model gains the capability to resist perturbations not only at the input but also within intermediate representations, rendering it more resilient.\n\n2.  **Evaluation with PGD Attack:**\n    *   The robustness of the proposed method is evaluated using the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack, a common iterative adversarial attack.\n    *   The paper focuses on small, \"imperceptible\" perturbations (controlled by the hyperparameter `\u03f5`), as these are more relevant to real-world scenarios. The threshold value is set at 0.01, since higher values can significantly alter the input image.\n    *   The authors analyze the impact of different perturbation strengths (`\u03f5` values) on the segmentation results.\n\n3.  **Network Architecture:**\n    *   They fine-tune a **SegFormer** model for the free-space segmentation task. SegFormer is a transformer-based architecture known for its multi-scale feature learning ability and generalization capabilities.\n    *   The SegFormer (MiT-B5) model is pre-trained on the Cityscapes dataset and replace the classification head for fine-tuning on our dataset.\n    *   The SegFormer architecture Merges the Transformer\u2019s architectural backbone with a lightweight decoder. In contrast to ViT, its Mix Transformer encoder (MiT) does not use any positional encodings and can generate multi-level feature maps (both high-resolution fine features and low-resolution coarse features) due to its hierarchical structure. Furthermore, a series of lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) is used as a decoder, which exhibits the attribute of combining both local and global attention, and eventually creates powerful and meaningful representations accompanied by strong generalization capabilities.\n\n4.  **Performance Metrics:**\n    *   The Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric is used to evaluate the performance of the segmentation models under adversarial attacks.\n\n**Related Work (Indicating Recent Trends):**\n\nThe \"Related Work\" section mentions several relevant techniques, some of which predate the last 2 years but provide context:\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:**  A foundational technique where models are trained on a mixture of clean and adversarial examples to improve robustness.  The paper cites Goodfellow et al. (2014) and Madry et al. (2017) as key references.\n*   **Input Transformation:** Modifying input data to make it more resilient to adversarial perturbations.  Guo et al. (2017) is cited.\n*   **Model Distillation:** Smoothing the model's output to reduce sensitivity to high-frequency perturbations.  Papernot et al.

DD is a technique for compressing large datasets into smaller, synthesized ones.\n\n*   It introduces **BEARD**, a new open and unified benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the adversarial robustness of DD methods. This is a central contribution.\n\n*   It uses an *adversarial game framework* to systematically assess DD methods under various attack scenarios. This framework combines attack performance and efficiency considerations.\n\n*   It proposes new metrics to evaluate adversarial robustness of distilled datasets:\n    *   **Robustness Ratio (RR):** Measures the effectiveness of models resisting adversarial attacks.\n    *   **Attack Efficiency Ratio (AE):** Quantifies the efficiency of attacks in terms of time.\n    *   **Comprehensive Robustness-Efficiency Index (CREI):** Integrates RR and AE into a unified metric.\n\n*   The benchmark includes a leaderboard to rank existing DD methods based on these metrics.\n\n*   Open-source code, a Model Pool, and a Dataset Pool are provided to facilitate adversarial robustness evaluations.\n\n**Key Trends and Findings:**\n\n*   **Dataset Distillation and Adversarial Robustness:** The central trend is the investigation of how dataset distillation techniques affect adversarial robustness.

DSA, DM, and BACON are often highlighted as achieving a more balanced performance in terms of both robustness and efficiency, especially under targeted attacks.\n\n*   **Trade-off Between Robustness and Accuracy:** The paper acknowledges a trade-off. While DD methods can improve robustness, they *may* reduce model performance on clean (non-adversarial) data.\n\n*   **Importance of Evaluation Metrics:** The paper stresses the importance of considering both attack *effectiveness* (RR) and attack *efficiency* (AE) when evaluating robustness, which is why it proposes the CREI metric.  Previous benchmarks may have only focused on attack effectiveness.\n\n**Benchmark Details (BEARD):**\n\n*   **Dataset Pool:** Includes distilled datasets generated by DC, DSA, DM, MTT, IDM, and BACON across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet with IPC settings of 1, 10, and 50.  These are largely sourced from publicly available datasets.\n\n*   **Model Pool:** Contains models trained on the distilled datasets.  Models with the highest validation accuracy are selected.\n\n*   **Attack Library:** Uses the Torchattacks library, including FGSM, PGD, C&W, DeepFool, and AutoAttack. Both targeted and untargeted attacks are used. A perturbation budget of |\u03f5| = 8/255 is used for most attacks.\n\n*   **Leaderboard:** Ranks methods based on RR, AE, and CREI for different datasets and IPC settings.\n\n**Related Work (Most Relevant):**\n\n*   Mention is made of \"DD-RobustBench\" [41] which is another adversarial robustness benchmark, but the authors claim that it only evaluates distilled datasets in a single IPC setting and considers only attack effectiveness, not efficiency.\n\n*   They also mention TrustDD [24] and [3].\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\n*   Expanding the benchmark to include more DD methods, more sophisticated attacks, and larger datasets.\n*   Investigating effective *attacks* on DD methods.\n*   Extending the evaluation to other modalities (text, graphs, audio).\n\n**List of recent papers (last 2 years):**\n- George Cazenavette, Tongzhou Wang, Antonio Torralba, Alexei A Efros, and Jun-Yan Zhu.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the paper addressing the research question, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification in the last 2 years (2022-2024 assuming the current date).\n\n**Paper Title:** Exploiting Frequency Spectrum of Adversarial Images for General Robustness\n\n**Key Focus:** The paper addresses the vulnerability of CNNs to image perturbations and aims to achieve general robustness against different types of perturbations. It proposes a frequency-based data augmentation method, Adversarial Amplitude Swap (AAS), to improve model performance on clean, adversarial, and common corruption datasets.  The core idea is to emphasize the phase components of images during adversarial training.\n\n**Core Idea and Proposed Method (AAS):**\n\n*   **Problem:**  Achieving robustness against various perturbations (adversarial, common corruptions) is challenging. Improving robustness to one type can degrade performance on others.  CNNs tend to be biased towards texture information (amplitude components in the frequency domain), whereas human recognition relies more on shape information (phase components).\n*   **Hypothesis:** A generally robust classifier should capture semantic information from phase components while being robust to variance in the amplitude.\n*   **Adversarial Amplitude Swap (AAS):**  This is the proposed data augmentation method.  It swaps the amplitude spectrum between clean and adversarial images to generate two new training images:\n    *   **Adversarial Amplitude (AA) images:**  Have the amplitude spectrum of the adversarial image and the phase spectrum of the clean image.\n    *   **Adversarial Phase (AP) images:** Have the amplitude spectrum of the clean image and the phase spectrum of the adversarial image.\n*   **Implementation:** AAS can be integrated into various adversarial training setups. AA and AP images act as substitutes for original adversarial images.\n*   **Expected Outcome:**  The method is intended to enable CNNs to better extract semantic information from adversarial images, leading to more robust classifiers.\n*   **Frequency Domain:** They use Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) to manipulate the amplitude and phase components of the images.\n\n**Key Findings and Contributions (with an emphasis on trends for robustness):**\n\n*   **General Robustness:** AAS is claimed to improve model performance on clean, adversarial, and common corruption datasets. It can prevent catastrophic and robust overfitting. The model trained with AAS performs more uniformly across all types of common corruptions.\n*   **Performance Boost:** ResNet-50, when trained with AAS on CIFAR-10 under PGD adversarial training, showed improvements in clean (+4.6%), adversarial (+6.1%), and common corruption (+4.9%) accuracies.\n*   **Overfitting Prevention:** AAS helps prevent catastrophic and robust overfitting during adversarial training.\n*   **Uniform Performance:** Models trained with AAS exhibit more consistent performance across different types of common corruptions (smaller difference between highest and lowest accuracy).\n*   **Phase Matters:** Experiments demonstrate that the phase spectrum contains most of the semantic information required for image classification. CNNs can learn from \"swap images\" (where amplitude spectra are swapped) because they retain the phase information.\n*   **AA Images Key:** AA images (static phase, stochastic amplitude) enable CNNs to better capture semantic information from the phase components while resisting adversarial features in the amplitude.\n\n**Related Work (highlighting recent trends and comparisons):**\n\n*   **Phase Component Focus:** The paper builds on the trend of exploiting the phase components of images to improve robustness.\n*   **Amplitude Swapping:** Previous work (Chen et al. [6] in *ICCV 2021*) proposed swapping amplitude spectra for robustness against common corruptions, but had little effect on adversarial perturbations. This paper extends that idea to adversarial training.  AAS uses *adversarial* perturbations in amplitude swapping to improve adversarial robustness.\n*   **Frequency Bias:**  Other research explores robustness by manipulating the frequency bandwidth of images (e.g., biasing towards low-frequency components). However, this approach has limitations as adversarial perturbations can be designed in any frequency domain.  This paper focuses on amplitude/phase rather than just bandwidth.\n* Kireev et al. [23] (UAI 2022) showed that adversarial training with weaker attacks can serve as a method to moderately enhance the robustness against common corruptions. This paper is in line with that, highlighting the utility of AA and AP images.\n* Mukai et al. [34] (ICIP 2022) suggested the use of frequency-based augmentation for out-of-distribution generalization.\n\n**Experimental Setup and Results Details:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10-C.\n*   **Models:** ResNet-50, ResNet-18, WideResNet-40-2, DenseNet.\n*   **Adversarial Training Methods:** Standard adversarial training, TRADES.\n*   **Adversarial Attacks:** FGSM, PGD (l-infinity norm).\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Clean accuracy, adversarial accuracy, common corruption accuracy.\n*   **Common Corruptions:** Gaussian noise, shot noise, impulse noise, defocus blur, glass blur, motion blur, zoom blur, snow, frost, fog, brightness, contrast, elastic, pixelate, JPEG compression.\n*   The training with AA images consistently resulted in best overall performance.\n*   The study explores how models perform using different components: (i) yp, (ii) yq and (iii) both yp and yq as targets to demonstrate whether CNNs can capture generalizable information from each of the frequency components.\n*   Adversarial Amplitude Swap (AAS) Algorithm: The process of AAS is performed as follows: 1) Given a clean image x, an adversarial image xadv is generated. 2) The DFT is applied to the two images to obtain the amplitude-phase decompositions, (A(x), P(x)) and (A(xadv), P(xadv)). 3) AA and AP images are then constructed by the IDFT of (A(x), P(xadv)) and (A(xadv), P(x)), respectively.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   The proposed AAS method leads to CNN classifiers with general robustness and uniform performance.\n*   Emphasis on phase components in adversarial training is crucial.\n\n**Overall Trends Evident in the Paper (within the last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Focus on Frequency Domain:**  Analyzing and manipulating images in the frequency domain (amplitude and phase spectra) is an active area of research for improving robustness.\n2.  **Phase as Key to Robustness:** There's growing recognition that the phase information in images is crucial for robustness, aligning CNNs more closely with human perception.\n3.  **Data Augmentation Techniques:** Novel data augmentation techniques, like AAS, are being developed to improve robustness during training, specifically targeting adversarial robustness while preserving clean accuracy.\n4.  **Addressing Overfitting:**  A significant challenge in adversarial training is overfitting to specific types of attacks. Research is focusing on methods to prevent catastrophic and robust overfitting.\n5.  **General Robustness:** The trend is moving beyond just adversarial robustness to achieving \"general robustness\" \u2013 resilience to a wider range of perturbations, including common corruptions.\n6.  **Trade-offs:** Researchers are still exploring the trade-offs between accuracy and robustness. Methods like TRADES are used to explore these trade-offs.\n7.  **Utility of Weaker Attacks:** Weaker adversarial attacks in adversarial training are being used as a method to enhance the robustness against common corruptions and improve the model's accuracy.\n\nThis paper contributes to these trends by introducing AAS, a frequency-based data augmentation method that enhances adversarial training and promotes general robustness."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information from the paper relevant to the research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years,\" focusing on details from the last 2 years.\n\n**Overall Trend Identified in the Paper:**\n\nThe paper identifies a trend of combining Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with adversarial training to find architectures that balance high accuracy and good robustness against adversarial attacks.  The problem that prior works only leverage adversarial examples to train NAS to generate the architectures with good robustness and neglect the accuracy of the architectures is a problem. Also, the paper identifies that lots of popular NAS methods emerges, such as DARTS [1\u20133], SPOS [4], and so on. However, the performance of architectures searched by these popular NAS methods is not often good enough with bad robustness [5].\n\n**Key aspects and relevant information from the paper (including limitations):**\n\n*   **Problem:** Traditional NAS-generated models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training enhances robustness but can reduce accuracy, creating a trade-off.\n*   **Proposed Solution:** The paper introduces Robust Neural Architecture Search (RNAS) to design architectures with both high accuracy and good robustness.\n*   **Methodology of RNAS:**\n    *   Uses a regularization term that considers the correlation between the output of the supernet on natural data and adversarial data to balance accuracy and robustness.\n    *   Two sub-methods:\n        *   **RNAS-max:** Uses adversarial examples as input to train NAS. It leverages PGD to generate adversarial examples.\n        *   **RNAS-uniform:** Uses random noise examples instead of adversarial examples to reduce search cost.\n*   **Algorithms:** The paper explicitly outlines two algorithms, **Algorithm 1 RNAS-max** and **Algorithm 2 RNAS-uniform**.\n*   **Experimental Results (CIFAR-10):**\n    *   RNAS-max: 2.65% test error, 53.67% robust accuracy under FGSM attack.\n    *   RNAS-uniform: 2.60% test error, 53.74% robust accuracy under FGSM attack.\n    *   RNAS-max achieves good robust accuracy by standard training or adversarially training, it gets the highest robust accuracy than other methods. However, RNAS-uniform has bad performance on robustness, and it means that RNAS-uniform sacrifices the robustness of the architecture and has a little effect on accuracy by using noise examples as input.\n*   **Comparison to Other Methods:**\n    *   RNAS outperforms standard DARTS in both accuracy and robustness.\n    *   RNAS-max achieves a good balance between accuracy and robustness compared to other methods.\n    *   RNAS-uniform sacrifices some robustness for faster search time.\n*   **Limitations:**\n    *   RNAS-max has high computational complexity due to being a three-level optimization problem.\n    *   RNAS-uniform has worse robustness compared to RNAS-max.\n\n**Specific References from the Last 2 Years (Important for your research question):**\n\nThe following references are explicitly cited in the paper and fall within the last 2 years (2022-2024, since the current year is 2024).  I am listing them as they appear in the paper with relevant context:\n\n*   **[3] Xunyu Zhu, Jian Li, Yong Liu, and Weiping Wang, \u201cImproving differentiable architecture search via selfdistillation,\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.05629, 2023.** (This is a paper by the authors themselves, and relevant because it explores improving differentiable architecture search.)\n\n**Other potentially relevant references (though publication dates need verification):**\n\n*   **[2] Xunyu Zhu, Jian Li, Yong Liu, Jun Liao, and Weiping Wang, \u201cOperation-level progressive differentiable architecture search,\u201d in 2021 IEEE International Confer_ence on Data Mining (ICDM).

The trend is to develop methods and regularization techniques that address this trade-off.\n3.  **Differentiable NAS (DARTS and variants):** The paper utilizes and builds upon Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), indicating the continued relevance and adaptation of this approach in the context of adversarial robustness.  This involves searching for optimal architectures using gradient-based optimization.\n4.  **Efficiency Considerations:** There's a focus on improving the efficiency of robust NAS methods, as evidenced by the RNAS-uniform approach, which uses noise examples to reduce the search cost. Balancing search cost and robustness remains a key area of development.\n5.  **Adversarial Training Integration:**  Adversarial training (using adversarial examples during training) remains a vital component. The trend is to combine it *with* NAS for even better results.\n6.  **The Role of Noise:** The investigation into noise examples (RNAS-uniform) suggests an interest in exploring alternative, less computationally expensive methods to approximate or complement adversarial training in NAS."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"**\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper & Relevance to Adversarial Robustness Trends:**\n\n*   **Explaining Perceptually-Aligned Gradients (PAGs):** The paper primarily investigates the underlying mechanisms behind perceptually-aligned gradients (PAGs) in robust computer vision models. While not directly a *new method* for robustness, it provides insights into *why* robust models exhibit certain properties, which is a key area of ongoing research in the field. Understanding PAGs is relevant because they have been linked to improved model interpretability, generative capabilities, and even improved robustness itself.\n*   **Off-Manifold Robustness:** The paper's central thesis is that PAGs arise due to \"off-manifold robustness.\" This means that robust models are *more* robust to perturbations *off* the data manifold (i.e., in directions not aligned with the typical data distribution) than *on* the data manifold. This is a novel perspective on robustness, as traditional robustness focuses on defending against perturbations within a certain radius around data points (which can be seen as on-manifold robustness).\n*   **Regimes of Robustness:** The authors identify three distinct regimes of robustness:\n    *   *Weak Robustness:* Low robustness overall.\n    *   *Bayes-Aligned Robustness:* Optimal balance where the model is off-manifold robust and accurate, leading to PAGs.\n    *   *Excessive Robustness:* Over-regularization leads to decreased accuracy, potentially due to excessive on-manifold robustness at the expense of fitting the data distribution.\n\n**II. Robust Training Methods Investigated (within the scope of the question, explicitly mentioned):**\n\nThe paper explicitly explores the connection between PAGs and the following robust training techniques:\n\n*   **Adversarial Training with Projected Gradient Descent (PGD):** This is a standard adversarial training method where the model is trained to be robust against adversarially crafted perturbations generated using PGD.  The paper cites Madry et al. (2018) as a foundational work.\n*   **Randomized Smoothing:** This technique achieves certified robustness by averaging the model's predictions over multiple noisy versions of the input.  The paper cites Cohen et al. (2019) as a key reference.\n*   **Gradient Norm Regularization:** This approach penalizes the magnitude of the input gradients during training, promoting smoother decision boundaries and increased robustness to noise. Drucker and Le Cun (1992) and Srinivas and Fleuret (2018) are cited in relation to this.\n*   **Smoothness Penalty:**  The model is penalized for large changes in output given small changes in input (noise), with the goal of improving robustness.\n\n**III. Key Findings and Contributions Relevant to Trends in Robustness:**\n\n*   **Off-Manifold Robustness as a Key Factor:** The paper posits that off-manifold robustness is a crucial factor in explaining PAGs. This suggests that future research on adversarial robustness should consider strategies that explicitly promote off-manifold robustness, rather than solely focusing on on-manifold defenses.\n*   **Theoretical Connection to Bayes Optimal Classifiers:** The authors provide theoretical arguments linking Bayes optimal classifiers to off-manifold robustness and PAGs. This could guide the development of new robustness techniques inspired by the properties of Bayes optimal models.\n*   **Signal-Distractor Decomposition:** The paper introduces the concept of signal-distractor decomposition, where inputs are divided into discriminative \"signal\" components and non-discriminative \"distractor\" components. They show that robust models are more robust to noise on the distractor component, suggesting that focusing on aligning gradients with the signal manifold is important for achieving robust and interpretable models.\n*   **Quantifying Perceptual Alignment:**  The paper proposes using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric to quantify the perceptual similarity between model gradients and the score of the data distribution (estimated using diffusion models). This provides a way to objectively measure the effectiveness of different robustness techniques in terms of perceptual alignment.\n*   **Empirical Validation:**  The paper presents extensive empirical results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and a modified MNIST dataset to support their theoretical claims. These results show that models trained with different robustness objectives (gradient norm regularization, randomized smoothing, adversarial training) exhibit off-manifold robustness and that this correlates with perceptual alignment.\n*   **Connection to Generative Models:** The authors use score-based generative models (specifically diffusion models) to estimate the score of the data distribution. This highlights the increasing interplay between discriminative and generative models in the context of adversarial robustness.\n\n**IV. Limitations (Pointing to Potential Future Research):**\n\n*   **Lack of Rigorous Theoretical Explanation for Off-Manifold Robustness:** The paper acknowledges that while they provide arguments for why robust models exhibit off-manifold robustness, they do not have a complete theoretical explanation.\n*   **Approximation of Bayes Optimal Classifier:**  The authors use the score of a diffusion model as a proxy for the gradients of a Bayes optimal classifier, but they acknowledge that this is an approximation.\n\n**V.

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** DIFFender: Diffusion-Based Adversarial Defense against Patch Attacks\n\n**Key Focus and Relevance:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Robustness for Image Classification:** The paper *directly* addresses adversarial robustness by proposing a defense mechanism (DIFFender) against adversarial attacks, specifically patch attacks, on image classification models.\n*   **Diffusion Models:** It leverages recent advancements in diffusion models to improve robustness, which is a relevant trend.\n*   **Patch Attacks:** The focus on patch attacks is significant, as these are more realistic threats in physical-world scenarios than traditional l_p norm bounded perturbations.\n\n**Findings and Proposed Method (DIFFender):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Anomaly Perception (AAP) Phenomenon:**  The core innovation is the discovery of the AAP phenomenon. This is the observation that diffusion models respond differently to adversarial patches compared to natural images. Specifically, during the denoising process, adversarial patches exhibit resistance to both denoising and restoration, leading to detectable differences. This difference can be leveraged to *localize* adversarial patches.\n*   **DIFFender Framework:** Based on AAP, DIFFender is a two-stage defense:\n    1.  **Patch Localization:** It uses the AAP phenomenon to identify the region of the adversarial patch by comparing denoised images generated with and without textual prompts using a text-guided diffusion model.  A one-step denoising process is used for speed.\n    2.  **Patch Restoration:**  Once localized, the identified patch region is restored using the same text-guided diffusion model.  The mask of the patch is combined with the adversarial image as input.\n*   **Prompt Tuning:** An efficient prompt-tuning algorithm is developed to fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model for the adversarial defense task. This tuning is done with a few-shot approach, meaning it requires only a small number of training examples. The prompt tuning optimizes for both localization and restoration.  The tuning uses a combination of cross-entropy loss (for mask prediction), L1 loss (for image restoration), and a feature distance loss (to align high-level features of the restored image with the original).\n*   **Unified Diffusion Model:** DIFFender uses a single diffusion model for both localization and restoration, allowing for a close interaction between the stages.\n*   **Vision-Language Pre-training:** Leverages vision-language pre-training to perform zero-shot localization and restoration.\n\n**Experimental Results and Claims:**\n\n*   **Effectiveness:** DIFFender demonstrably reduces the attack success rate, even under strong adaptive attacks (BPDA+AdvP, BPDA+LaVAN).\n*   **Generalization:** It generalizes well to various scenarios, diverse classifiers (Inception-v3, Swin-S, ResNet50, ViT-B-16), and multiple attack methods (AdvP, LaVAN, GDPA, RHDE), even when only tuned on a small number of examples from a single attack.  It also is effective in the physical world.\n*   **Robustness:** DIFFender demonstrates robustness to naturalistic attacks and is less sensitive to patch size compared to other methods.\n\n**Related Work Analysis (Relevant to Trend Identification):**\n\n*   **Limitations of Existing Defenses:** The paper points out the limitations of adversarial training, certified defenses (poor generalization), and pre-processing techniques (visual artifacts, gradient obfuscation).\n*   **Diffusion-Based Defenses:** It acknowledges the emergence of diffusion models for improving adversarial robustness but notes that previous attempts (like DiffPure) struggle with patch attacks due to the trade-off between purifying the adversarial perturbations and preserving image semantics.\n*   **Comparison to Other Patch Defenses:** It compares DIFFender to other defenses like Digital Watermarking (DW), Local Gradient Smoothing (LGS), Feature Normalization and Clipping (FNC), SAC, and Jedi, highlighting the advantages of DIFFender in terms of reconstruction quality and robustness to adaptive attacks.\n\n**Paper Dates and Recent Trend Confirmation:**\n\n*   The paper includes references to other papers published in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. This means that using diffusion models for improving adversarial robustness is a relatively recent trend, making the proposed work relevant to the research question.\n\n**Summary of Trends based on the Paper:**\n\nBased on this paper, here are some key trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years:\n\n1.  **Diffusion Models for Defense:** Diffusion models are increasingly being explored as a potential tool for improving adversarial robustness. The key idea is to use the generative capabilities of diffusion models to \"purify\" or repair adversarial examples. However, effectively applying diffusion models, especially against more complex attacks like patch attacks, requires overcoming challenges related to preserving image semantics during the purification process.\n2.  **Focus on Patch Attacks:**  There's a growing interest in defending against patch attacks. This reflects a shift toward addressing more realistic, physical-world threats. Traditional l_p-norm bounded perturbations are often less relevant in practical scenarios.\n3.  **Adaptive Attack Robustness:**  A critical area of focus is building defenses that are robust to *adaptive* attacks. Attackers are continuously developing new methods to circumvent defenses. Defenses must be evaluated against attackers who are aware of the defense mechanism and can optimize their attacks to evade it (white-box setting).\n4.  **Vision-Language Models:** Leveraging vision-language pre-trained models for adversarial defense is emerging.  This allows for transfer learning and use of rich semantic information to improve robustness.\n5.  **Few-Shot Learning/Prompt Tuning:**  Efficiently adapting defenses to new attacks or scenarios is important.  Few-shot learning and prompt tuning techniques allow for adapting pre-trained models with limited data.\n6.  **Joint Optimization:** Optimizing multiple aspects of the defense (e.g., localization and restoration) together can lead to improved overall performance.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper highlights the trend of using diffusion models for adversarial robustness, particularly against patch attacks, and contributes a novel approach (DIFFender) that leverages the AAP phenomenon and prompt tuning to achieve state-of-the-art defense performance. The paper also underscores the importance of robustness against adaptive attacks and the potential of vision-language pre-training in this field."

      "summary": "Okay, I have carefully analyzed the provided paper in Markdown format to extract the most relevant information regarding the research question:  **What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.**\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the findings:\n\n**I. Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper investigates the adversarial robustness of **safety-driven unlearned diffusion models (DMs)**, particularly in the context of text-to-image generation.  It focuses on whether these DMs, designed to prevent the generation of inappropriate or harmful images, can be bypassed using adversarial prompts (subtly perturbed text inputs).  The paper's main goal is to evaluate and benchmark the robustness of these unlearned DMs. The focus is on image generation, but the attack is performed on the classification of the image.\n*   The paper does *not* primarily focus on adversarial robustness for general image classification models.  Instead, it looks at a specific class of generative models (diffusion models) and their ability to resist adversarial attacks in the text prompt domain that lead to unsafe image generation.\n*   **Key Contribution:** The authors introduce a novel adversarial attack method called **UnlearnDiffAtk**. This method leverages the inherent classification capabilities of diffusion models to generate adversarial prompts without relying on auxiliary models (unlike previous approaches).\n\n**II. Relevance to the Research Question:**\n\nWhile the paper's primary subject isn't *directly* about adversarial robustness in traditional image classification, it has significant relevance because:\n\n*   **Adversarial Attacks:** It explores adversarial attacks, a core concept in robustness research, but applied to the text prompts of diffusion models. The goal is to make the DM generate images it's supposed to avoid.\n*   **Defense Mechanisms:** The paper investigates the robustness of \"unlearned\" DMs, which can be seen as a defense mechanism against generating unsafe content. It assesses how well these defenses hold up against adversarial attacks.\n*   **Evaluation/Benchmarking:**  A major contribution is the development of UnlearnDiffAtk as a tool for *benchmarking* the robustness of unlearned DMs.  This aligns with the broader goal of understanding and improving robustness.\n*   **Latest Trends:**  The paper implicitly addresses the \"latest trends\" by focusing on diffusion models, a relatively recent and rapidly evolving area in generative AI. The references in the paper are mostly from the last 3 years which indicates the timeliness of this work.\n\n**III. Key Information Extracted Regarding Trends and Techniques:**\n\n1.  **Diffusion Models and Adversarial Robustness (Recent Trend):** The intersection of diffusion models and adversarial robustness is a growing area of research.  The paper highlights the need to evaluate the safety and trustworthiness of these powerful generative models.\n2.  **Adversarial Prompts (Jailbreaking):**  The use of adversarial prompts (or \"jailbreaking\" attacks) is a key technique for testing the robustness of DMs. The paper notes that while adversarial prompting has been explored, there's limited work on evaluating the robustness of *machine unlearning* within DMs.\n3.  **UnlearnDiffAtk:  Leveraging DM's Inherent Classification Ability:**\n    *   **Novelty:** This is the paper's core contribution and a potential trend.  UnlearnDiffAtk simplifies adversarial prompt generation by using the DM itself as a \"diffusion classifier.\"  This eliminates the need for auxiliary models (either another DM or an external image classifier).\n    *   **Mechanism:**  It exploits the fact that a DM can be used for classification by applying Bayes' rule to the generation likelihood.  It optimizes the adversarial prompt to maximize the probability that the DM will generate the target (unsafe) image. The optimization objective is shown in equation (8).\n    *   **Efficiency:** The paper emphasizes the computational efficiency of UnlearnDiffAtk compared to methods like P4D (a concurrent work), as it avoids the overhead of running additional models.  Experimental results in Tables 2, 3, and 4 demonstrate this efficiency, with UnlearnDiffAtk achieving comparable or better attack success rates (ASR) in less time.\n4.  **Benchmarking Unlearned DMs:** The paper's experimental section (Section 5) describes a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of several state-of-the-art unlearned DMs, including:\n    *   ESD (Erased Stable Diffusion)\n    *   FMN (Forget-Me-Not)\n    *   AC (Ablating Concepts)\n    *   UCE (Unified Concept Editing)\n    *   SLD (Safe Latent Diffusion)\n5.  **Unlearning Tasks Considered:** The benchmark evaluates robustness across different unlearning scenarios:\n    *   Concept Unlearning (erasing harmful concepts like nudity, violence, illegal activity)\n    *   Style Unlearning (disregarding a particular painting style, like Van Gogh)\n    *   Object Unlearning (discarding knowledge of specific object classes)\n6.  **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper uses Attack Success Rate (ASR) as the primary metric. For style unlearning, they also consider Top-1 ASR and Top-3 ASR, recognizing that style classification can be nuanced.\n7.  **Limitations of Current Defenses:**  The experiments demonstrate that current unlearned DMs are still vulnerable to adversarial prompts, even with subtle perturbations. This highlights the need for more robust defense mechanisms.\n8.  **Importance of Robustness Evaluation:**  The paper emphasizes the need for systematic and reliable benchmarks to assess the robustness of unlearned DMs and ensure their trustworthiness.\n\n**IV. Specific Details from the Paper:**\n\n*   **Fig. 1:**  Provides a visual comparison of different attack methodologies, highlighting the distinction between UnlearnDiffAtk and existing works.\n*   **Fig. 2:**  Illustrates the pipeline of UnlearnDiffAtk.\n*   **Fig. 3:** Depicts how internet-sourced target images can be used with UnlearnDiffAtk.\n*   **Tables 2, 3, and 4:** Present detailed experimental results comparing UnlearnDiffAtk to other methods (including a concurrent work called P4D) across different unlearning tasks. These tables quantify the effectiveness and efficiency of UnlearnDiffAtk.\n*   **Table 5:**  Shows the ASR of UnlearnDiffAtk when attacking ESD with different versions of Stable Diffusion.\n*   **Section 4:** Explains the mathematical derivation of UnlearnDiffAtk.\n*   **Section 5:** Describes the experimental setup and results.\n*   **Section 6:** Concludes the paper.\n\n**V. Limitations:**\n\n*   The paper does not provide a comprehensive overview of the *entire* field of adversarial robustness for image classification. Its scope is limited to DMs and, specifically, to adversarial attacks in the text prompt domain.\n*   The paper is focused on white-box attacks, where the adversary has access to the model's parameters.  The robustness against black-box attacks (where the attacker has limited knowledge of the model) is not explored in depth.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper contributes to the understanding of adversarial robustness in the context of image generation using diffusion models. It introduces UnlearnDiffAtk, a novel and efficient attack method, and provides a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of safety-driven unlearned DMs. While not directly addressing general image classification, the paper's techniques and findings are relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness, particularly in the context of generative AI and defense mechanisms against generating unwanted content. The research provides a valuable contribution to the trends in diffusion model robustness by highlighting the need for robust adversarial defenses."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper**\n\nThe paper introduces \"DIFFender,\" a novel defense framework against adversarial patch attacks on image classification models. It leverages diffusion models to locate and restore these patches, even extending to infrared images.  Since the paper was published in 2024 and references work from 2022 and 2023, it definitely falls within the required timeframe.\n\n**Key Contributions and Trends Related to Adversarial Robustness**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant trends and how DIFFender addresses them, with specific details extracted from the paper:\n\n1.  **Focus on Real-World, Patch-Based Attacks:**\n\n    *   The paper explicitly acknowledges that traditional adversarial attacks using L<sub>p</sub>-norm perturbations (altering every pixel slightly) are often impractical in real-world settings.\n    *   **Trend:**  A growing interest in *adversarial patch attacks* is noted because they focus perturbations on specific, localized regions, making them more feasible in physical environments. The paper mentions these attacks pose significant threats to applications like face recognition and autonomous driving.\n    *   **DIFFender's Solution:** It's *specifically designed* to defend against these patch attacks. The introduction states that many existing defenses are insufficient for real-world applications.\n\n2.  **Limitations of Existing Defenses:**\n\n    *   **Trend:**  The paper criticizes existing defenses:\n        *   Adversarial training and certified defenses are effective *only against specific types of attacks* and fail to generalize well to other patch attacks.\n        *   Pre-processing techniques (image completion, smoothing) often *struggle to preserve image fidelity*, introduce visual artifacts, and are vulnerable to stronger *adaptive attacks* that exploit gradient obfuscation.\n    *   **DIFFender's Solution:** The paper argues that DIFFender overcomes these limitations through its unique approach.\n\n3.  **Leveraging Diffusion Models for Robustness:**\n\n    *   **Trend:**  The paper highlights the *rising prominence of diffusion models* as a powerful class of generative models that have shown promise in enhancing adversarial robustness through data purification.\n    *   **DIFFender's Solution:**\n        *   **Adversarial Anomaly Perception (AAP):** DIFFender is based on the novel \"Adversarial Anomaly Perception\" (AAP) phenomenon. This refers to the observation that diffusion models can accurately detect and locate adversarial patches by analyzing distributional anomalies in denoised versions of an image. Patches resist denoising differently than the rest of the image.\n        *   **Unified Localization and Restoration:** DIFFender integrates patch localization and restoration within a single diffusion model framework.  Precise localization aids effective restoration, and vice versa.\n        *   **Prompt Tuning:** DIFFender uses an efficient *few-shot prompt-tuning algorithm* to adapt a pre-trained diffusion model to the defense task without extensive retraining. This addresses the computational cost associated with diffusion models.\n\n4.  **Adaptability and Generalization:**\n\n    *   **Trend:** The need for defenses that generalize well across various scenarios, classifiers, and attack methodologies.  The paper emphasizes that many existing defenses are too specialized.\n    *   **DIFFender's Solution:**\n        *   The authors conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that DIFFender significantly reduces attack success rates, even against strong adaptive attacks.\n        *   The paper explicitly states that DIFFender generalizes well across various scenarios, different classifiers (CNN-based Inception-v3 and Transformer-based Swin-S), and multiple attack methods.\n        *   The system wasn't specifically re-tuned for facial recognition tasks, underscoring its generalizability across different scenarios and attack methods.\n\n5.  **Extending Robustness to Multi-Modal Data (Infrared):**\n\n    *   **Trend:** While most adversarial defense research focuses on the RGB modality, there's a growing recognition of the importance of robustness in other modalities like infrared imagery.\n    *   **DIFFender's Solution:**\n        *   DIFFender extends to *infrared patch defense*. This is a key innovation.\n        *   They address the challenges of domain shift (visible to infrared) by designing an \"Infrared Domain Constrained (IDC) Token\" to improve the prompt.\n        *   They also introduce two new loss functions for prompt tuning: \"Temperature Non-uniformity Correction Loss\" and \"Infrared Edge-aware Loss,\" to account for the weaker textures in infrared images.\n        *   The method is presented as the first to concurrently address both RGB and infrared modalities, further validating multi-modal attack defense.\n\n6.  **Defending Against Physical Attacks**\n    * The paper also provides a solution for attacks in the physical world by placing stickers on real-world objects and testing DIFFender under various conditions, including different angles (rotations) and distances. The results demonstrate that\n        DIFFender maintains robust defensive capabilities across\n        a range of physical alterations, proving its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n\n**In Summary: Latest Trends Addressed by DIFFender**\n\n*   **Real-world relevance:** Defending against physically plausible attacks (patch attacks).\n*   **Adaptability:** Generalizing across different attack types and classifiers.\n*   **Efficiency:** Using diffusion models without incurring prohibitive computational costs (prompt tuning).\n*   **Multi-modality:** Extending defenses to infrared imagery.\n*   **Using the power of diffusion models:** Using generative AI to purify images with adversarial attacks.\n\nThe paper argues that DIFFender represents a significant advancement in addressing these trends. It offers a more robust, adaptable, and efficient defense against adversarial patch attacks compared to existing methods. The extension to infrared is particularly noteworthy, as it tackles a less-explored but increasingly important area of adversarial robustness."

The paper introduces a novel defense mechanism against adversarial attacks.\n\n**Key Trends and Techniques Discussed:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Purification:** The paper centers around adversarial purification as a defense strategy. This involves removing adversarial perturbations from images before they are fed into a deep learning model. This is framed as a trend that is application-independent and integrates well into existing AI4EO workflows.\n\n*   **Diffusion Models:** The most significant trend highlighted is the use of diffusion models for adversarial defense. This involves:\n    *   **Forward Diffusion:** Gradually adding Gaussian noise to an image (adversarial example) until it becomes pure noise.\n    *   **Reverse Denoising:**  Iteratively removing the noise to reconstruct a clean image.  The paper positions diffusion models as a next-generation generative model, offering robust generalization capabilities.\n\n*   **Universal Adversarial Defense:** Aims to defend against various adversarial attacks using a single, unified model, which contrasts with methods tailored to specific attacks.\n\n*   **Adaptive Noise Level Selection (ANLS):**  This is a key component of the proposed method. It addresses the challenge of determining the optimal level of noise to add during the diffusion process. ANLS leverages a task-guided Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) ranking strategy to dynamically select the best noise level for purification.\n*   **Pre-trained models:** The UAD-RS framework leverages pre-trained diffusion models to establish generalization capabilities in adversarial-free domains. This reduces the training efforts for multiple attack settings while maintaining high performance without prior knowledge of adversarial perturbations.\n\n**State-of-the-Art Comparison:**\n\n*   The paper benchmarks against existing adversarial purification methods like:\n    *   **Pix2Pix:** A GAN-based image-to-image translation model.\n    *   **Perturbation Seeking Generative Adversarial Networks (PSGAN):** A hybrid approach combining adversarial training and purification.\n    *   **Task-Guided Denoising Network (TGDN):** A DNN-based purification method.\n\n**Limitations of Existing Methods (Justifying the Need for the Proposed Approach):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** Often only effective against perturbations seen during training and struggles to generalize.\n*   **Randomization-based methods:** Degraded feature quality due to noisy data mixtures.\n*   **Detection-based methods:** Compromise dataset integrity.\n*   **GAN-based methods:** Training instability, limited sampling diversity, and difficulty in defending against heterogeneous attacks.\n*   **CNN-based methods:** Inadequate generalization capabilities.\n\n**Specific Contributions of the paper (UAD-RS):**\n\n1.  **Universal Adversarial Defense Framework:** A framework (UAD-RS) is developed, which uses a unified pre-trained diffusion model to improve the robustness of AI4EO applications against adversarial attacks by mixing random noise with the adversarial examples and purifying the mixture into adversarial-free examples through a forward diffusing and a reverse denoising process.\n2.  **Adaptive Noise Level Selection Algorithm:** An algorithm (ANSL) is proposed to dynamically find the optimal noise level for the diffusing and denoising processes in UAD-RS based on a task-guided FID ranking strategy, achieving optimal purification performance for universal adversarial examples with heterogeneous patterns.\n\n**Adversarial Attacks Evaluated:**\n\n*   The paper evaluates its defense against a comprehensive set of adversarial attacks, including:\n    *   **White-box attacks:** Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Iterative FGSM (IFGSM), Trade-off Projected Gradient Descent (TPGD), Carlini and Wagner (CW) attack, Jitter\n    *   **Black-box attacks:** Mixcut, Mixup\n\n**Datasets Used (for evaluation in remote sensing):**\n\n*   UC-Merced (UCM)\n*   Aerial Image Dataset (AID)\n*   Vaihingen\n*   Zurich Summer\n\n**Key Insights from Experiments and Ablation Studies:**\n\n*   **Superior Performance:** UAD-RS outperforms existing methods in defending against a wide range of attacks.\n*   **Importance of Noise Level:**  The Adaptive Noise Level Selection (ANLS) is critical for optimal performance.\n*   **Potential for Cross-Domain Purification:** The model can generalize to some extent to datasets it wasn't trained on, but performance is reduced.\n*   **Image Synthesis capabilities:** Diffusion models show great promise in generating high quality and diverse remote sensing images.\n\n**Limitations of UAD-RS:**\n\n*   **Computational Cost:** More computationally expensive than traditional DNN-based purification methods due to diffusion and denoising steps.\n*   **Sensitivity to High-Contrast Data:** Performance may be affected by high-contrast remote sensing data with extreme brightness values.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\n*   Extending the purification model to defend against adversarial attacks in other remote sensing applications.\n*   Exploring the potential of UAD-RS for tasks like domain adaptation and image enhancement.\n\n**In summary,** the paper suggests that diffusion models, particularly when combined with adaptive noise selection, represent a promising trend in adversarial robustness for image classification, offering a universal defense mechanism that can handle a variety of attacks without requiring retraining for each specific attack type.

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** MIMICDIFFUSION: PURIFYING ADVERSARIAL PERTURBATION VIA MIMICKING CLEAN DIFFUSION MODEL\n\n**Key Areas Addressed Regarding Adversarial Robustness (Last 2 Years):**\n\n1.  **Adversarial Purification via Diffusion Models:**\n\n    *   The paper focuses on a specific trend: using diffusion models for adversarial purification. This involves taking an adversarially perturbed image (an image with a small, intentional modification that fools a neural network) and using a diffusion model to generate a \"clean\" version of the image, which is then fed to a classifier.\n    *   **Problem Highlighted:** The authors argue that even diffusion-based purification methods are affected by adversarial perturbations because the diffusion model itself is a deep network processing the perturbed input. This deviates the generative process from that of a clean image.\n    *   **Proposed Solution (MimicDiffusion):** The core contribution is a novel method called \"MimicDiffusion\" designed to approximate the generative process of a diffusion model as if it were working with a clean image directly, thereby reducing the impact of adversarial perturbations.\n\n2.  **MimicDiffusion Technique Details:**\n\n    *   **Guided Diffusion Backbone:** MimicDiffusion uses guided diffusion as its foundation. This means it starts with Gaussian noise and uses the adversarial sample as a \"guide\" during the reverse diffusion process.\n    *   **Manhattan Distance (L1 Norm):**  A key element is using Manhattan distance (L1 norm) instead of Euclidean distance (L2 norm) in the guidance term. The authors analyze the gradients and argue that using L1 distance helps to mitigate the influence of adversarial perturbations. They divide this into \"long-range\" and \"short-range\" distances.\n        *   **Long-Range Guidance:** When the generated image is significantly different from the original (clean) image, the gradients of the guidance terms are the same for clean and adversarial samples when using L1 distance. Thus the adversarial sample is used directly as guidance.\n        *   **Short-Range Guidance:** When the generated image is very close to the original image, they propose a non-linear transform inspired by super-resolution. This operation projects the generated and adversarial images into a higher-dimensional space, increasing the Manhattan distance and effectively turning it into the long-range case.\n\n3.  **Comparison to Existing Methods:**\n\n    *   **Adversarial Training:** The paper contrasts MimicDiffusion with adversarial training, a common defense method that involves training classifiers on adversarially perturbed examples. The authors note that adversarial training can be ineffective against unknown attack methods.\n    *   **Other Purification Methods:**  The paper compares against other adversarial purification techniques, including GAN-based and score-based methods.\n    *   **Diffusion-Based Purification Methods (Specifically):** It positions MimicDiffusion as an improvement over existing diffusion-based methods like DiffPure and GDPM. The authors argue that these methods still suffer from the effects of adversarial perturbations on the diffusion process itself and often rely on finding optimal hyperparameters.\n\n4.  **Experimental Results and Datasets:**\n\n    *   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.\n    *   **Classifiers:** WideResNet-28-10, WideResNet-70-16, ResNet50.\n    *   **Attack Methods:** AutoAttack (\u2113\u221e, \u03f5 = 8/255), AutoAttack (\u21132, \u03f5 = 0.5), PGD attack (\u2113\u221e, \u03f5 = 8/255), C&W attack, BPDA+EOT.\n    *   **Performance:** MimicDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in robust accuracy compared to other methods. For example, on CIFAR-10 with WideResNet-28-10, it achieves 92.67% average robust accuracy against AutoAttack (\u2113\u221e, \u03f5 = 8/255), which is 18.49% higher than the state-of-the-art baselines. Similar improvements are reported for CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.\n    *   **Adaptive Attacks:** The paper specifically evaluates against adaptive attacks like BPDA+EOT, which are designed to circumvent purification methods. MimicDiffusion shows strong performance even against these attacks.\n\n5.  **Key Contributions Summarized:**\n\n    *   A new perspective for diffusion-based adversarial purification by mimicking the generative process of a clean diffusion model.\n    *   The MimicDiffusion technique with Manhattan distance, long-range guidance, and short-range guidance.\n    *   State-of-the-art performance on various adaptive attack benchmarks.\n\n**In essence, the paper highlights a trend of using diffusion models for adversarial robustness, identifies a limitation in existing methods, and proposes a novel solution (MimicDiffusion) with significant performance improvements.

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this research paper and extract the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focusing on Trends in the Last 2 Years (2022-Present):**\n\nBased on the provided paper, here are the trends it highlights and contributes to in the realm of adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on the relevant timeframe:\n\n**1. Randomized Smoothing (RS) and its Limitations (Ongoing Trend):**\n\n*   RS remains a promising approach for providing certified robustness to image classifiers (a trend continuing from before the last 2 years). The paper acknowledges RS's ongoing relevance.\n*   However, the \"curse of dimensionality\" is a significant obstacle. As image resolution (input dimension) increases, the certified robustness radius of RS *decreases*.  This is a recognized problem in the field.\n*   The core issue is the uncertainty introduced by high-dimensional Gaussian noise used in standard RS.\n\n**2. Mitigation Strategies for the Curse of Dimensionality (Key Trend, Addressed by the Paper):**\n\n*   The paper explicitly targets mitigating the curse of dimensionality, which is a growing concern within the RS research area.\n*   **Dual Randomized Smoothing (DRS):** The paper's *major contribution* and a potential trend is the introduction of DRS. DRS aims to address the curse of dimensionality by:\n    *   Downsampling the input image into two lower-dimensional sub-images.\n    *   Applying randomized smoothing *separately* to these sub-images.\n    *   Combining the results to provide certified robustness for the *original, high-dimensional* input.\n    *   DRS aims to provide a tighter \u21132 certified robustness for high-dimensional input via dual smoothing in the lower-dimensional space\n    *   DRS achieves a more promising \u21132 robustness upper bound that decreases at a rate of (1/\u221am + 1/\u221an) with m + n = d.\n\n**3. Enhancing Noise Prediction (Related Trend):**\n\n*   The paper mentions approaches that enhance the perdition of the classifier under Gaussian noise corruption. Carlini et al. (2023) introduce a potent denoiser founded on the diffusion model, representing a substantial advancement in noise mitigation that greatly enhances overall robustness\n\n**4. Training Strategies for RS Enhancement (Ongoing Trend, DRS Compatible):**\n\n*   The paper references and builds upon several training strategies to improve RS models:\n    *   **Gaussian Augmentation:** Training classifiers with images augmented with Gaussian noise (Cohen et al., 2019).\n    *   **Consistency Regularization:**  Adding a consistency regularization to the base classifier (Jeong & Shin, 2020).\n    *   **Diffusion-Based Denoising:** Using deep learning-based denoisers to purify noise-corrupted images before classification (Carlini et al., 2023).\n    *   **Adversarial Training:** Using adversarial training (Salman et al., 2019)\n    *   **Model Ensembles:** Using model ensemble (Horv\u00b4ath et al., 2022)\n\n**5. Spatial Redundancy Exploitation (Specific Implementation Detail in DRS):**\n\n*   The paper's DRS implementation leverages the spatial redundancy present in images. It uses down-sampling kernels based on 2x2 pixel indexes to partition the image into sub-images. This helps preserve information during the dimensionality reduction process.\n\n**6. Evaluation Metrics:**\n\n*   The paper evaluates performance using:\n    *   **Certified Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified samples with a certified radius greater than a given value.\n    *   **Average Certified Radius (ACR):** Average certified radius across correctly classified samples.\n\n**Explicit Citations of Relevant Recent Papers:**\n\n*   **Wu et al. (2021):**  Demonstrates the \u21132 certified radius of RS diminishes at a rate proportional to 1/ _\u221ad._\n*   **Horv\u00b4ath et al. (2022):** Uses model ensemble to reduce the overall prediction variance.\n*   **Carlini et al. (2023):** Introduces a potent denoiser founded on the diffusion model, representing a substantial advancement in noise mitigation that greatly enhances overall robustness.\n*   **Hao et al. (2022):** Certified robustness against semantic transformations via generalized randomized smoothing.\n*   **Kakizaki et al. (2023):** Certified defense for content based image retrieval.\n*   **Pfrommer et al.

(2022):** Proves that the input-dependent RS also suffers from the curse of dimensionality\n\n**Summary of Trends:**\n\n1.  **RS remains a core technique**, but the curse of dimensionality is a major hurdle.\n2.  **Mitigation of the curse of dimensionality** is a key research direction. DRS is presented as a novel solution.\n3.  **Integration of denoisers**, particularly diffusion-based models, improves robustness.\n4.  **Combining DRS with existing training strategies** (Gaussian augmentation, consistency regularization, etc.) yields better performance.\n5.  **Exploiting spatial redundancy** in images is used to improve dimensionality reduction techniques.\n6.  **Model ensembling** can further boost the performance of RS-based methods (including DRS).\n\nIn essence, the paper positions itself within the active research area of improving randomized smoothing to overcome its limitations, particularly in high-dimensional image classification.  The core trend is to find ways to make RS more effective as image resolutions increase, and the paper offers a novel contribution (DRS) to that end."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper, tailored to answer the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Please note that the provided paper is about *text* classification, not *image* classification. Therefore, it is inherently irrelevant to the research question.**\n\nHowever, if we are to proceed under the assumption the research question is about text classification, here's the extracted information.\n\n**General Trends (in the context of text, not image, classification):**\n\n*   **Certified Robustness:** A significant trend is the move towards *certified robustness*. This approach aims to provide guarantees that a classifier's prediction will remain invariant to a specified set of adversarial perturbations. The motivation is to move beyond empirical defenses that are often broken by new attacks. The paper mentions this has gained considerable interest as a result of competition between attackers and defenders.\n\n*   **Randomized Smoothing:** Within certified robustness, *randomized smoothing* has emerged as a particularly promising technique. It essentially wraps around a black-box model and introduces randomness into the prediction process to make it more robust. The paper builds upon this trend.\n\n*   **Edit Distance Robustness:** A key focus is on achieving robustness against *edit distance* perturbations. This means defending against adversaries that can insert, delete, or substitute words in the input text. This is considered a more general threat model than those that only consider synonym substitutions.\n\n*   **Multi-Class Certification:** Extending robustness techniques to *multi-class* classification problems is another active area. Previous work in certified robustness for text often focused on binary classification.\n\n**Specific Relevant Information from the Paper (if the question was about text classification):**\n\n*   **CERT-ED (Proposed Method):** The paper introduces CERT-ED, a \"CERTified Edit Distance defense\" method for natural language classification. It is a multi-class extension of Randomized Deletion.\n    *   It leverages randomized smoothing with deletion noise to achieve certifiable robustness under arbitrary attacks within a computed edit distance radius.\n    *   The paper claims it outperforms the existing Hamming distance method RanMASK in 4 out of 5 datasets in terms of both accuracy and the cardinality of the certificate.\n    *   It improves empirical robustness in 38 out of 50 settings when evaluated against various direct and transfer attacks.\n\n*   **RanMASK (Baseline):**  RanMASK (Zeng et al., 2023) is mentioned as a certified baseline method that provides provable guarantees for Hamming distance under a fixed number of word substitutions. The paper argues that RanMASK is limited as it doesn't defend against general perturbations (like word insertions).\n\n*   **Randomized Deletion (Basis):** CERT-ED builds upon Randomized Deletion (Huang et al., 2023), but extends it to multi-class classification and the language domain.\n\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   **Certified Radius (CR):**  A measure of robustness, indicating the size of perturbations the model can withstand.\n    *   **Certified Cardinality (CC):** A discrete analogue of certified volume, used to compare certificates with different geometries (edit distance vs. Hamming distance).  It represents the number of perturbed textual inputs within the certificate.\n\n*   **Attacks Used for Evaluation:**\n    *   Clare (Li et al., 2021)\n    *   BAE-I (Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020)\n    *   BERT-Attack (Li et al., 2020)\n    *   TextFooler (Jin et al., 2020)\n    *   DeepWordBug (Gao et al., 2018)\n\n**Key Takeaways (again, if about text classification):**\n\n*   The trend is towards stronger robustness guarantees (certified robustness) rather than just empirical defenses.\n*   Edit distance is a focus as a more general and realistic threat model for text.\n*   Randomized smoothing, particularly with deletion mechanisms, is a promising direction.\n*   Multi-class certification is a needed advancement.\n\n**Limitations (from the paper):**\n\n*   Randomized smoothing can reduce benign accuracy at higher smoothing levels.\n*   Performance may differ on other base model architectures and natural language tasks.\n*   The approach introduces computational overheads."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information addressing the research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**Core Trend: Self-Supervised Learning for Certified Robustness**\n\n*   **Denoising and Masked Autoencoders (DMAE):** The paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning method called Denoising Masked AutoEncoders (DMAE). This approach involves corrupting images with Gaussian noise and masking patches, then training a Transformer-based model to reconstruct the original image. The key idea is that this process forces the encoder to learn robust features that are both semantically meaningful and resistant to noise.\n\n*   **Single-Stage Robust Representation Learning:**  DMAE contrasts with previous two-stage approaches (like Carlini et al., 2022) that use separate denoising and classification models. DMAE aims to learn robust representations directly within a single compact network (Vision Transformer), making it more parameter-efficient.\n\n*   **Gaussian Smoothing:** The pre-trained encoder from DMAE is used as the base classifier within a Gaussian smoothed model framework. Gaussian smoothing is a technique that adds Gaussian noise to the input and transforms any model into a Gaussian smoothed classifier. This allows for analytically computing a certified radius, providing provable robustness guarantees.\n\n**Key Details of the DMAE Approach:**\n\n*   **Architecture:**  DMAE uses an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture based on Vision Transformers (ViT). The encoder processes noisy, unmasked patches, while the decoder reconstructs the original image from the encoder's representation and masked token embeddings.\n\n*   **Training:** The encoder and decoder are jointly optimized using a pixel-level mean squared error loss. The loss is calculated on all patches.\n\n*   **Fine-tuning:** For downstream classification, the encoder is used to initialize a Gaussian smoothed classifier, which is then fine-tuned using a consistency regularization method.\n\n*   **Consistency Regularization:** The consistency regularization loss function (from Jeong & Shin, 2020) aims to:\n    *   Maximize the accuracy of the base classifier with perturbed input.\n    *   Encourage the model's predictions to be consistent across different noise perturbations.\n    *   Prevent the prediction from low confidence scores\n\n**Performance Highlights (ImageNet):**\n\n*   DMAE ViT-Base (87M parameters) achieves competitive or better certified accuracy than Carlini et al. (2022), while using significantly fewer parameters (Carlini et al., 2022 uses a model with 857M parameters).\n*   DMAE ViT-Large (304M parameters) significantly surpasses state-of-the-art results, establishing a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet. For example, at r = 1.5, it achieves 53.7% accuracy which is 15.3% better than Boosting (Horv\u00b4ath et al., 2022) and surpasses Diffusion (Carlini et al., 2022) by 12.0% at r = 2.0.\n\n**Transferability (CIFAR-10):**\n\n*   The pre-trained DMAE model demonstrates good transferability to the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving decent improvement even after adapting to the data distribution shift by pre-training on the CIFAR-10 dataset before fine-tuning.\n*   DMAE outperforms the original consistent regularization method significantly, proving its transferability to other datasets. Specifically, it outperforms the original consistent regularization by 12.0% at r = 0.25 and by 9.0% at r = 0.5.\n\n**Related Works and Comparisons:**\n\n*   **Gaussian Smoothing:** Builds upon the foundation of Gaussian smoothed models (Cohen et al., 2019) and subsequent improvements in training methods (Salman et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2021; Jeong & Shin, 2020; Horv\u00b4ath et al., 2022; Jeong et al., 2021).\n*   **Denoising:** Different from Salman et al. (2020); Carlini et al. (2022) that use two models trained for separated purposes, the authors believe that a single compact network has enough expressive power to learn robust feature representation.\n*   **Self-Supervised Learning in Vision:** Leverages the growing trend of self-supervised learning for image representation, particularly masked image modeling (MAE, He et al., 2022). Compares with contrastive learning approaches (Chen et al., 2020; He et al., 2020).\n\n**Key Papers Mentioned (Published within the last 2 years, relevant to the research question):**\n\n*   **Carlini et al. (2022):**  A key benchmark. Achieved high certified accuracy using a two-stage approach with a denoising diffusion model and a BEiT model.  The DMAE paper aims to improve upon this by using a single-stage, more parameter-efficient approach.\n*   **Horv\u00b4ath et al.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed breakdown of the relevant information to address your research question (\"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"):\n\n**Overall Relevance & Limitations:**\n\n*   **Focus:** The paper primarily focuses on *certified robustness* for *medical image segmentation*, not image classification. While some concepts are transferable, it's important to note this difference.\n*   **Timeframe:** The paper was submitted/published in 2023 (acknowledged by \"This work was granted access to the HPC resources of IDRIS under the allocation **2023**-AD011013308R1\"). Therefore, it falls within your desired timeframe of the last 2 years.\n\n**Key Trends & Techniques (related to adversarial robustness, even if applied to segmentation):**\n\n1.  **Certified Robustness is Gaining Traction:**\n    *   The paper highlights a growing interest in *certified defenses* as opposed to purely empirical defenses. Empirical defenses, while improving robustness, don't provide theoretical guarantees and can often be bypassed by stronger, adaptive attacks.\n    *   The authors explicitly state that while defenses for classification and segmentation tasks exist in medical imaging, *certified defenses are under-studied* by the medical community. This underlines a trend towards the need for more rigorous, provable robustness.\n\n2.  **Randomized Smoothing:**\n    *   This is a core technique employed in the paper.  It involves adding random noise (typically Gaussian) to the input image and then using a smoothed classifier.\n    *   The key idea: By smoothing the classifier, you can derive robustness guarantees \u2013 a certified radius (R) within which any perturbation of the input is guaranteed not to change the classification/segmentation result.\n\n3.  **Leveraging Diffusion Models for Denoising:**\n    *   This is a key *novelty* of the paper. The authors propose using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) *in conjunction with* randomized smoothing to *improve* certified robustness.\n    *   The approach involves first adding Gaussian noise to the input (as in standard randomized smoothing), then using the DDPM to denoise the noisy image *before* feeding it to the segmentation model.\n    *   **Why this is important:** Adding noise for smoothing creates a trade-off: more noise improves the certified radius but can hurt accuracy. Denoising aims to mitigate this trade-off by removing the noise while preserving the important image features.\n    *   The paper experiments with both single-step and multi-step denoising strategies, finding that single-step denoising performs best.\n\n4.  **Off-the-Shelf Models:**\n    *   The authors emphasize that their method works with pre-trained, off-the-shelf denoising and segmentation models. This is a significant advantage, as it removes the need to train models specifically for robustness.\n\n5.  **Addressing Performance Metrics:**\n    *   The paper focuses on certified Dice score and certified mean Intersection over Union (IoU) as the key performance metrics and the percentage of abstentions is being reported to show how many pixels the model's prediction confidence was insufficient with respect to the radius R.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Methodologies Described:**\n\n*   **Randomized Smoothing Implementation:** The paper briefly describes the mathematical formulation of randomized smoothing, including how to define the smooth classifier *g(x)* based on the base classifier *f(x)* and a Gaussian noise distribution.\n*   **Diffusion Model Integration:** The paper outlines the process of mapping between the noise model used in randomized smoothing and the noise model used in diffusion models. This is crucial for using DDPMs for denoising within the randomized smoothing framework.\n*   **Holm-Bonferroni Correction:** The paper mentions using the Holm-Bonferroni method for multiple-testing correction. This is relevant because randomized smoothing is applied to each pixel separately, and considering the entire segmentation region would imply a union bound with significantly reduced confidence.\n\n**Limitations of the Study:**\n\n*   The study is limited to medical image segmentation.\n*   The DDPM denoiser is an unconditional denoiser, and there is potential for improvement by using a conditional denoiser.\n*   The paper only performs single-step denoising, and there is potential for improvement by using a multi-step denoiser.\n\n**In summary,** while the paper directly addresses adversarial robustness for *segmentation* rather than classification, it showcases important trends: the shift towards *certified defenses*, the use of *randomized smoothing*, and the innovative application of *diffusion models for denoising* to enhance robustness. These concepts are relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness in image analysis."

It focuses on *malware detection*. However, it draws inspiration from and adapts techniques used in image classification (specifically adversarial robustness) to the malware domain. I will present the information accordingly, highlighting the connections and adaptations.\n\n**I. Summary of the Paper's Approach:**\n\n*   **Problem:** Deep learning-based malware detectors are vulnerable to adversarial malware examples (malware modified to evade detection).\n*   **Proposed Defense:** A (de)randomized smoothing technique adapted for malware detection. This involves training a classifier on *chunks* (subsets of contiguous bytes) of the executable file, rather than the whole file or randomly noised versions of the file. At test time, multiple chunks are classified, and a consensus is used for the final prediction.\n*   **Key Idea:** By focusing on chunks, the defense aims to be more resilient to attacks that inject adversarial content, as the injected content will only affect a portion of the chunks.\n*   **Two Chunk Selection Strategies:**\n    *   **Randomized Chunk-based Ablation (RCA):** Randomly select the locations of the chunks.\n    *   **Structural Chunk-based Ablation (SCA):** Select contiguous, adjacent chunks in an orderly way from the start of the input byte sequence to its end.\n*   **Evaluation:** The proposed defense (RCA-MalConv and SCA-MalConv) is tested against state-of-the-art evasion attacks on the BODMAS dataset and compared to a non-smoothed classifier (NS-MalConv) and a randomized smoothing-based classifier (RS-MalConv).\n\n**II. Relevant Information Addressing the Research Question (with adaptations to image classification where possible):**\n\nWhile this paper doesn't focus on image classification, it uses a technique inspired by research in that area. The relevant trend this paper leverages is **(de)randomized smoothing** for adversarial robustness. The adaptation and analysis of this technique is novel for malware detection.\n\n1.  **(De)Randomized Smoothing as a General Trend (adapted from image classification):**\n\n    *   The paper explicitly states that their approach is \"inspired by (de)randomized smoothing [12], a class of certifiably robust image classifiers which have been proposed against patch attacks.\"  This establishes (de)randomized smoothing as a relevant, although not exclusive, trend in adversarial robustness.\n    *   The core idea of randomized smoothing (in the context of image classification) is to add random noise to the input data during both training and inference. This aims to make the classifier's predictions more stable and resilient to small perturbations, effectively \"blurring\" the decision boundaries.  **(Citation [21]: Cohen, Rosenfeld, and Kolter, ICML 2019)**.\n\n    *   **(Citation [12]: Levine and Feizi, NeurIPS 2020)** is given for the original paper of (de)randomized smoothing for certifiable defense against patch attacks.\n\n2.  **Adaptation for Malware Detection (Chunk-Based Ablation):**\n\n    *   The paper argues that directly applying randomized smoothing (e.g., adding random noise) is *not* optimal for malware detection because: \"Unlike image pixels or text characters, the bytes within executable files serve functional roles, and arbitrary modifications to these bytes can break the intended functionality of the executable. As a result, randomized smoothing, which inject random noise, might not be the most suitable defense against adversarial malware examples.\"\n\n    *   Therefore, they propose a *chunk-based ablation* approach as a more suitable adaptation of (de)randomized smoothing.  Instead of random noise, they selectively ablate (remove) portions of the input file during training and inference.\n\n    *   The key innovation is the use of *contiguous byte chunks* rather than arbitrary noise, taking into account the structure and functionality of executable files.\n\n3.  **Specific Techniques/Architectures Used:**\n\n    *   **Base Classifier:** The paper uses MalConv [4], a shallow CNN architecture that learns features directly from raw byte inputs. It is not a novel contribution of this paper.\n    *   **RCA-MalConv:** Implements randomized chunk-based ablation (randomly selected chunks) with MalConv as the base.\n    *   **SCA-MalConv:** Implements structural chunk-based ablation (sequentially adjacent chunks) with MalConv as the base.\n\n4.  **Evaluation Against State-of-the-Art Attacks:**\n\n    *   The paper evaluates the proposed defense against several published evasion attacks, including:\n        *   Slack+Padding [7]\n        *   Shift [10]\n        *   GAMMA [8]\n        *   Code caves [11]\n    *   These attacks represent different strategies for manipulating executable files to evade detection, such as injecting content at the end of the file, between headers and sections, or within newly created sections.\n\n5.  **Adversarial Training (Discussed, but not the focus):**\n\n    *   The paper mentions adversarial training as an alternative defense.  However, it notes that adversarial training is computationally expensive, and models trained this way are still vulnerable to unknown threats.  **(Citation [18]: Lucas et al, USENIX 2023)**\n\n**III. Key Takeaways (for the Image Classification Context):**\n\n*   **(De)Randomized smoothing is a relevant concept:** The paper leverages the concept of (de)randomized smoothing from the image classification domain and adapted it for malware detection. However, the vanilla technique of randomized smoothing is difficult to apply to other domains due to differences in input structure.\n*   **Chunk-based Approach as a Potential Adaptation:** The idea of using \"chunks\" or localized subsets of the input data as a basis for smoothing could be a useful adaptation of randomized smoothing for other domains.\n*   **The Importance of Domain Knowledge:** The paper highlights the importance of considering the specific characteristics of the data and the attacks when designing a defense.  Directly transferring techniques from one domain (image classification) to another (malware detection) may not be optimal.\n*   **Model-Agnostic Defense:** The authors emphasize that their approach is \"model agnostic,\" meaning it can be applied to different underlying classifier architectures.\n\n**IV. Limitations of the Paper Regarding the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Domain Specificity:** The paper primarily focuses on malware detection, which is significantly different from image classification. While it draws inspiration from image classification techniques, the adaptations are tailored to the malware domain.\n*   **Date of Publication:** The paper itself does not provide a comprehensive survey of the *latest* (within the last 2 years) advancements in adversarial robustness for *image classification*. It only leverages the concept from prior art. To fully address the research question, one would need to consult other, more recent, surveys and publications specifically focused on image classification.\n\nIn summary, this paper provides valuable insights into how (de)randomized smoothing techniques can be adapted to improve the adversarial robustness of malware detectors. While it does not directly address trends in image classification, it highlights the general importance of domain-specific adaptations of existing defense mechanisms."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper to answer the research question \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Note:** This paper primarily focuses on *segmentation*, but it discusses techniques applicable to classification and mentions relevant advancements.  The extraction highlights those parts and synthesizes them with the core problem of image classification robustness.\n\n### **Summary of Relevant Information**\n\nThis paper, while centered on certified robustness for *image segmentation*, touches upon recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification.  The key trends, based on citations and discussions within the paper, are:\n\n1.  **Use of Diffusion Models for Denoising in Randomized Smoothing:**\n    *   This is a major trend. The paper builds upon work using diffusion models to *denoise* inputs before classification.  This is a technique to enhance robustness.\n    *   Specifically, the paper cites Carlini et al. (2023) as extending work by Salman et al. (2020) by using off-the-shelf Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs).  DDPMs are generative models that can generate real-world images from Gaussian noise.\n    *   The idea is that by denoising a potentially adversarial image *before* feeding it to the classifier, the classifier is more likely to make a correct, robust prediction.\n    *   The paper itself implements this denoising approach for segmentation, demonstrating its potential.\n\n2.  **Continued Development of Randomized Smoothing Techniques:**\n    *   Randomized smoothing remains a prominent method. The paper cites Cohen et al. (2019) as a foundational work. The core idea is to convolve a classifier with a Gaussian distribution during inference.\n    *   The paper acknowledges the \"trade-off between adding enough noise for certification and preserving the input's semantic information.\"\n    *   Ettedgui et al. (2022) and Carlini et al. (2023) are referenced as exploring potential solutions to this trade-off, suggesting active research in improving randomized smoothing.\n    *   The use of denoising diffusion models is presented as a way to mitigate the information loss caused by the noise in randomized smoothing.\n\n3.  **Lipschitz Constant-Based Defenses:**\n    *   While not the main focus, the paper mentions defenses based on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks.\n    *   It cites Trockman and Kolter (2021), Meunier et al. (2022), Araujo et al. (2023), Yu et al. (2022), Prach and Lampert (2022), and Xu et al. (2022) as relevant works in this area.\n    *   The paper notes that these methods, while offering fast certificate computation, \"suffer from important drawbacks\" such as reduced natural and certified accuracy and limited scalability to large datasets.\n    *   Araujo et al. (2023) proposes a unified algebraic perspective on Lipschitz neural networks.\n\n4.  **Vision Transformers for Robustness**\n    *   The paper cites Mao et al. (2022) and Chen et al. (2023), which indicate that Vision Transformers (ViTs) may be inherently more robust to adversarial attacks than other architectures. The paper's experiments confirm that denoising models combined with ViTs achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation certification results.\n\n### **Detailed Extraction with Citations**\n\nHere's a more granular breakdown, including direct quotes and citation details:\n\n*   **Introduction of Adversarial Examples:**  \"Neural networks have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (Szegedy et al., 2013; Madry et al., 2018; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Carlini and Wagner, 2017), *i.e., imperceptible variations of natural examples, crafted* to deliberately mislead the models.\"\n\n*   **Certified Defenses:** \"In recent years, significant efforts have been made to develop certified defenses that guarantee a specified level of robustness against adversarial inputs within a certain radius.\"\n\n*   **1-Lipschitz Networks:** Mentions \"1-Lipschitz Networks (Trockman and Kolter, 2021; Meunier et al., 2022; Araujo et al., 2023), bound propagation (Gowal et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2021), randomized smoothing (Li et al., 2019a; Cohen et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2019)).\"\n\n*   **Randomized Smoothing as a Leading Technique:** \"Randomized smoothing has emerged as the leading technique for certified robustness due to its scalability and model-agnostic properties.\"\n\n*   **Trade-off in Randomized Smoothing:** \"However, this technique exhibits a trade-off between adding enough noise for certification and preserving the input's semantic information for accurate predictions.\"\n\n*   **Impossibility Results:**  \"In fact, several impossibility results from an information-theory perspective have been introduced (Kumar et al., 2020; Blum et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) and inherently limit randomized smoothing from providing large certified radii.\"\n\n*   **Potential Solutions and Denoising:** \"Nevertheless, recent works, both theoretical (Ettedgui et al., 2022; Mohapatra et al., 2020) and empirical (Salman et al., 2020; Carlini et al., 2023), have explored potential solutions to this trade-off. To address the issue of removed information due to noise injection, several works, in the context of classification tasks, have proposed methods to denoise the input after the noise injection step (Salman et al., 2020; Carlini et al., 2023).\"\n\n*   **Diffusion Models for Denoising (Carlini et al., 2023):** \"Carlini et al. (2023) extended the work of Salman et al. (2020) by using off-the-shelf Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Mod_els (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Nichol and_ Dhariwal, 2021), a form of generative models that takes a random Gaussian noise and generates a real-world image.\"\n\n*   **Related Work - Lipschitz Constant Based Defenses:** \"In recent years, mainly two types of certified defenses have been proposed. The first approach provides robustness guarantees based on the Lipschitz constant of the networks and their margin... (Miyato et al., 2018; Farnia et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019b; Trockman and Kolter, 2021; Singla and Feizi, 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Meunier et al., 2022; Prach and Lampert, 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Araujo et al., 2023).\"\n\n*   **Diffusion Models:** \"Recently, diffusion probabilistic models have been applied successfully in the context of certified robustness for classification tasks where a diffusion model is used as a first step to denoise inputs for randomized smoothing (Carlini et al., 2023).\"\n\n*   **Vision Transformers for Robustness:** \"Going a step further, we can leverage the power of Vision Transformers which have been reported to be more robust to attacks (Mao et al., 2022), but also give state-of-the-art results on semantic segmentation tasks (Chen et al., 2023).\"\n\n### **Synthesized Trends for Image Classification Robustness (Last 2 Years):**\n\nBased on the extracted information:\n\n1.  **Denoising via Diffusion Models is a Promising Trend:** Using pre-trained or fine-tuned diffusion models to remove noise (including adversarial perturbations) *before* classification is a major area of development.  This helps overcome limitations of standard randomized smoothing. (Carlini et al., 2023)\n2.  **Randomized Smoothing Continues to Evolve:**  Researchers are actively working to improve randomized smoothing to mitigate the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. (Ettedgui et al., 2022; Mohapatra et al., 2020)\n3.  **Lipschitz Constant Regularization is an Alternative:** Methods based on controlling the Lipschitz constant of neural networks are still being explored, although they may have scalability and accuracy limitations. (Trockman and Kolter, 2021; Meunier et al., 2022; Araujo et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2022, Prach and Lampert, 2022, Xu et al., 2022)\n4.  **Vision Transformers may have improved robustness:** Vision transformers are observed to be more robust to attacks (Mao et al., 2022).\n\n**Important Caveats:**\n\n*   **Segmentation Focus:** This paper is about *segmentation* robustness.  While the techniques and cited papers are often applicable to classification, the empirical results presented are for segmentation tasks.\n*   **Citation Lag:**  Keep in mind that the \"last 2 years\" is relative to the publication date of *this* paper. Some cited papers may be slightly older than 2 years from *today*.\n*   **Completeness:** This extraction is based solely on the *provided paper*. A comprehensive literature review would involve searching directly for papers on image classification robustness in the relevant time period."

      "relevancy": "This paper introduces ARIEL, an adversarial graph contrastive learning method. It shows that ARIEL is more robust in the face of adversarial attacks, and it is within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "This paper, titled \"ArieL: Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning,\" published in December 2023, explores adversarial robustness in graph representation learning, which can be relevant to image classification due to the applicability of graph-based methods in computer vision. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Core Idea:**\n\n*   The paper proposes a novel graph contrastive learning framework called ArieL (Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning) that incorporates adversarial training to enhance robustness.\n*   ArieL uses an adversarial view as a new form of data augmentation in graph contrastive learning, which makes the data augmentation more informative under mild perturbations.\n*   The core idea is to generate an adversarial sample from the original graph by attacking both its topology (edges) and node features, making it harder for the model to discriminate.\n*   An \"information regularization\" technique is introduced to stabilize the adversarial training process and prevent the model from collapsing.\n*   The method is generalized to both node-level and graph-level classification tasks.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness in Image Classification (Considering the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:**  The use of adversarial training is directly relevant. The paper explicitly draws inspiration from recent works in adversarial training. Adversarial training is a well-established technique for improving robustness to adversarial examples in image classification. ArieL extends this concept to the graph domain.\n*   **Contrastive Learning:** The paper is situated within the domain of contrastive learning, a self-supervised technique which has gained popularity in image classification (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo). The idea of using contrastive learning to learn representations that are invariant to perturbations is relevant.  The adversarial view generation forces the model to learn representations that are robust to specific types of adversarial perturbations.\n*   **Data Augmentation:** ArieL frames adversarial attack as a new form of data augmentation. Data augmentation is critical for improving the generalization and robustness of image classifiers. This perspective allows adversarial examples to be seen as additional training samples.\n*   **Information Regularization:** Addresses the instability issues often encountered during adversarial training, a known problem in image classification as well. Information regularization stabilizes the training of adversarial graph contrastive learning by regularizing the mutual information among positive pairs.\n\n**Key Techniques and Contributions:**\n\n1.  **Adversarial View Generation:**\n    *   The paper generates adversarial examples by perturbing the graph's adjacency matrix (topology) and node features.\n    *   It uses Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to craft these adversarial examples, a common technique in image adversarial attacks.\n    *   Constraints are imposed on the perturbation to ensure it remains \"small\" and the adversarial sample stays close to the original graph.  Specifically, constraints on the number of edge modifications (\u0394A) and feature perturbation magnitudes (\u0394X) are used.\n2.  **Information Regularization:**\n    *   Addresses the instability often seen with adversarial training.\n    *   The regularization penalizes the similarity between views when that similarity exceeds the estimated upper bound.\n3.  **Node-Level and Graph-Level Application:**\n    *   The framework is designed to work at both the node level (embedding individual nodes) and the graph level (embedding entire graphs).  The connection between the node and graph levels is bridged by treating each graph instance as a super-node.\n4.  **Subgraph Sampling:**\n    *   Subgraph sampling is used for scalability\n    *   Avoids the gradient derivation on the whole graph\n    *   Increases the randomness of the sample and sometimes boosts the performance\n5.  **Curriculum Learning**\n    *   Used to avoid the imbalanced sample on isolated nodes.\n    *   Used to avoid that the adversarial contrastive loss is gradually increasing and the contrastive learning becomes harder as the training goes on.\n\n**Experimental Results and Claims:**\n\n*   ArieL outperforms existing graph contrastive learning methods in node classification and graph classification tasks.\n*   ArieL demonstrates higher robustness when faced with adversarial attacks (specifically, Metattack).\n*   Ablation studies show that both the adversarial contrastive loss and the information regularization contribute to the performance of ArieL.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* The subgraph size parameter for node-level contrastive learning has to be specified.\n* The curriculum learning hyperparameter values for weight and change period have to be specified.\n*The graph perturbation rate and feature perturbation rate also have to be specified.\n\n**Why this matters for Image Classification:**\n\n*   **Graph-based Image Classification:** The paper explores robustness in graph representation learning. Graphs are used in image classification for various purposes:\n    *   Representing relationships between image regions (scene graphs).\n    *   Analyzing image features as nodes in a graph.\n    *   Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to directly process image data represented as graphs.\n*   **Transfer of Techniques:** The adversarial training techniques developed for graphs in this paper could potentially be adapted and applied to image classification tasks, especially those that involve graph-based representations. For example, adversarial training could be applied to the scene graph to improve the robustness of the image classifier. The adversarial contrastive loss and information regularization can also be explored in other image classification settings.\n\n**Related work:**\n\n*   Graph contrastive learning is related to the methods that use DeepWalk, GNNs, Information Maximization and mutual information.\n*   Adversarial attack on graphs is related to the methods of edge flipping, PGD attack and poisoning attack of GNNs.\n*   Adversarial contrastive learning is related to previous research in visual domains which propose to use the adversarial sample as a form of data augmentation in contrastive learning, as well as AD-GCL.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\nThe paper \"ArieL: Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning\" presents a relevant approach to enhancing adversarial robustness in graph representation learning using adversarial training and contrastive learning principles. While focused on graphs, the underlying techniques and findings could be valuable for researchers working on improving the robustness of image classification models, particularly in contexts where graph-based representations are employed. The use of adversarial training, contrastive learning, and information regularization are all techniques worth considering in the image domain. The publication date (December 2023) falls within the specified 2-year timeframe."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information concerning the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on the last two years:\n\n**Core Idea of the Paper (YONA)**\n\n*   The paper introduces a novel data augmentation method called \"You Only Need hAlf\" (YONA).\n*   YONA's fundamental concept is to bisect an image, replace one half with noise, and apply data augmentation techniques to the remaining half.\n*   The authors argue this reduces redundant information in the original image and forces the neural network to recognize objects from incomplete views, increasing robustness.\n\n**Key Claims Regarding Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   **YONA markedly increases the resilience of neural networks to adversarial attacks.** This is one of the key benefits highlighted in the abstract and throughout the paper.\n*   The authors tested YONA using ResNet18 along with eight data augmentation strategies on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial attack. They found it significantly amplified the effectiveness of all methods on both datasets.\n*   The paper provides detailed experimental results to support this claim (see Section 4.3, \"Adversarial Robustness\").\n\n**Experimental Setup and Results for Adversarial Robustness (PGD Attack):**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\n*   **Model:** ResNet-18.\n*   **Attack:** Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).\n    *   Epsilon values of 8/255 for L\u221e bound, 0.25 (attacking) or 0.5 (training) for L2 bound.\n    *   4 steps of optimization.\n*   **Baseline:** A model trained without the YONA method.\n*   **Training Configuration:**\n    *   Batch size of 128.\n    *   Weight decay of 0.0002.\n    *   Momentum of 0.9.\n    *   200 epochs with a learning rate schedule (0.1 for epochs 0-99, 0.01 for epochs 100-149, 0.001 for epochs 150-200).\n*   **Data Augmentations Used:** Horizontal Flip (HFlip), Vertical Flip (VFlip), Color Jitter (Jitter), Random Erasing (Erasing), Cutout, Grid, Random Augmentation (RandAug), and Auto Augmentation (AutoAug).\n*   **Results Summary:**\n    *   **CIFAR-10:** YONA enhanced robust classification accuracy under PGD attacks, showing an average improvement of 4.17%. Improvements with Jitter and Cutout were particularly substantial (exceeding 5%).\n    *   **CIFAR-100:** YONA consistently boosted performance across all augmentation techniques, achieving an average accuracy increase of 4.21%. The improvement with Cutout reached 6.76%.\n\n**Key Attributes of YONA Contributing to Robustness (as stated in the paper):**\n\n1.  **Random Perturbation:** YONA introduces noise and eliminates superfluous details.\n2.  **Data Diversity:** Enriches the diversity of the training data.\n3.  **Visual Invariance Learning:** Forces the model to focus on critical visual elements, reducing the impact of extraneous information.\n4.  **Reduced Misleading Signals:** Ensures that adversarial samples are stripped of misleading cues, making them more instructive.\n\n**Additional Experiments:**\n\n*   The paper also tests YONA's robustness against the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack, finding that it benefits all 8 data augmentations on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   The paper notes that while YONA excels in image classification tasks (and boosts adversarial robustness in that context), it has limited or negative effects in object detection tasks. This is attributed to the fact that object detection requires precise localization, and YONA's masking can remove significant portions of the target or critical contextual information.\n\n**In summary:**  This paper contributes to the trend of using data augmentation techniques to improve the adversarial robustness of image classification models. YONA, the proposed method, is a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that enhances the robustness of various neural networks against adversarial attacks, specifically PGD and FGSM."

They argue that maintaining performance under such corruptions should be a *minimum requirement* for robust classifiers.\n    *   The paper finds that models, *even those trained with state-of-the-art data augmentation methods*, are often vulnerable to these imperceptible corruptions (high iCE values on CIFAR datasets).\n    *   **Relevance to the research question:** The focus on imperceptible corruptions may be seen as a trend in adversarial robustness, since it relates to making models robust against manipulations that are hard for humans to detect.\n\n2.  **Effectiveness of Training Data Augmentation with p-norm Corruptions:**\n    *   The paper shows that training data augmentation using *combinations* of p-norm corruptions can significantly improve corruption robustness. This is more effective than using individual p-norm corruptions alone (see models C1, C2, and C3 in the results).\n    *   The paper evaluates the transferability of robustness gained from training on one p-norm to other p-norms and to real-world corruptions. They find that L0 corruptions are a special case (robustness doesn't transfer well), but training on other p-norm corruptions (e.g., L0.5, L1) generally leads to better robustness across different p-norms.\n    *   **Relevance to the research question:** Training with combined perturbations/corruptions can be seen as a trend in adversarial robustness since it leads to better generalization.\n\n3.  **Combining p-norm Corruptions with State-of-the-Art Data Augmentation:**\n    *   The paper explores combining p-norm corruption training with existing data augmentation strategies like TrivialAugment (TA) (**M\u00a8uller and Hutter, 2021**), RandAugment (RA) (**Cubuk et al., 2020**), AugMix (AM) (**Hendrycks et al., 2019**) and Mixup (MU) (**Zhang et al., 2018**).\n    *   The results are mixed: improvements in mCE (mean Corruption Error) are often seen, but improvements in mCExN (mCE excluding noise corruptions) are less consistent.  For Tiny ImageNet, the C2 combination of p-norm corruptions can improve mCExN on top of other data augmentation methods.\n    *   **Relevance to the research question:** Combining different strategies could be seen as a trend in adversarial robustness.\n\n4.  **Choice of p-norm for Training:**\n    *   The paper shows that among the different p-norms, lower values of p (e.g., L0.5, L1) are generally more effective for training robust models (excluding L0). Training with L\u221e-norm corruptions performs worse overall.\n    *   **Relevance to the research question:** Better understanding how different norms lead to robust classifiers is important for adversarial robustness research.\n\n5.  **Influence of Data Augmentation on Learning Process**\n    *   The paper reveals that strong random training data augmentation has an implicit regularizing effect on the training process, flattening the learning curve.\n\n**Specific Citations of Relevant Papers (published in the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Erichson, N.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** IPMix: Label-Preserving Data Augmentation Method for Training Robust Classifiers\n\n**Key Idea & Relevance:**\n\n*   **Data Augmentation for Robustness:** The paper focuses on improving adversarial robustness (and other safety measures) through a novel data augmentation technique called IPMix. Data augmentation is a significant trend in improving model robustness because it increases the diversity of training data.\n*   **Addresses Accuracy vs. Robustness Trade-off:** The paper directly mentions addressing the perceived trade-off between accuracy on clean data and robustness against distribution shifts, including adversarial attacks. This is a critical trend: finding methods that improve robustness without sacrificing clean accuracy.\n\n**Key Components of IPMix (Addressing Different Levels of Augmentation)**\n\nThis is relevant because modern adversarial robustness techniques often involve a combination of approaches, not just pure adversarial training:\n\n*   **Integration of Image, Patch, and Pixel-Level Augmentation:** IPMix integrates three levels of data augmentation:\n    *   *Image-level:* Applies transformations to the entire image (brightness, sharpness, etc.).\n    *   *Patch-level:* Masks or replaces regions of the image.\n    *   *Pixel-level:* Mixes images using pixel-wise weighted averages.\n*   **Label-Preserving:** IPMix is explicitly designed to be label-preserving, meaning the augmented data maintains the original class label. This is crucial because label-violating augmentations can lead to manifold intrusion and hurt generalization.\n\n**How IPMix Enhances Robustness (Specific Mechanisms)**\n\n*   **Structural Complexity:** Introduces structural complexity from synthetic data (fractals) at different levels to generate more diverse images.\n*   **Random Mixing:** Uses random mixing methods for multi-scale information fusion. This is intended to improve data integration and increase diversity.\n*   **Scar-like Image Patches:** Employs scar-like image patches to enhance dataset diversity, especially beneficial for anomaly detection.\n\n**Experimental Results (Focus on Adversarial Robustness)**\n\n*   **CIFAR-100 Experiments:** Figure 7 shows that IPMix achieves lower error rates when subjected to adversarial attacks using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). This suggests improved adversarial robustness.\n*   **ImageNet Results:** Table 5 presents results on ImageNet and demonstrates IPMix\u2019s ability to achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance across a range of safety measures. These include ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and ImageNet-O.\n*   **Ablation Studies:** Tables 6 and 7 reveal the contribution of each IPMix component to adversarial robustness. Removing the image-level augmentation slightly improves the robustness against attacks. Conversely, removing pixel-level methods degrades adversarial robustness, given their inherent resistance to perturbations.\n*  **Comparison With Other Methods:** IPMix is compared to AutoAugment, RandAugment, TrivialAugment, SaliencyMix, PuzzleMix, Co-Mixup, and Manifold Mixup on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-100-C, with results demonstrating state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the benchmark (Table 9).\n\n**Connections to Related Work (Trends in Data Augmentation)**\n\nThe \"Related Works\" section provides context on the trends in data augmentation:\n\n*   **Image-Level Augmentation:** Mentions AutoAugment, Adversarial AutoAugment, TrivialAugment, AugMix, AugMax, and PRIME.\n*   **Pixel-Level Augmentation:** Mentions MixUp, Manifold MixUp, and PixMix. The paper highlights that IPMix shares similarities with PixMix but uses multi-scale information and better information fusion methods.\n*   **Patch-Level Augmentation:** Mentions CutOut, CutMix, Patch Gaussian, SaliencyMix, TokenMix, and AutoMix.\n\n**Safety Measures**\n\n*   **Robustness:** Discusses corruption robustness (ImageNet-C) and adversarial robustness. It acknowledges the trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean image accuracy, a recurring theme in research. Mentions ImageNet-O and ImageNet-A as benchmarks for evaluating performance under distribution shifts.\n*   **Anomaly Detection:** Improves performance on ImageNet-A and ImageNet-O for anomaly detection.\n\n**Other Notable Details:**\n\n*   **Code Availability:** The paper mentions that code is available at [https://github.com/hzlsaber/IPMix](https://github.com/hzlsaber/IPMix), which facilitates reproducibility and further research.\n*   **Improved Regularization Effect:** Data mixing compels the model to learn more robust features rather than relying on sample or class characteristics, which reduces overfitting and enhances the model\u2019s performance in different environments.\n\n**Limitations (Points for Future Research)**\n\n*   The approach primarily focuses on CNN, and its effectiveness on Visual Transformers requires additional experimental validation.\n*   Limited set of safety metrics and the performance of IPMix in real-world scenarios with more comprehensive safety measures warrants future investigation.\n*   The theoretical foundation of IPMix requires further development to gain deeper insights into its underlying principles.\n\n**Summary of Trends Evident in this Paper:**\n\n1.  **Data Augmentation as a Primary Defense:** Data augmentation remains a core strategy for improving adversarial robustness.\n2.  **Combined Augmentation Strategies:** The trend is moving towards combining different augmentation techniques (image-level, patch-level, pixel-level) to leverage their complementary strengths. IPMix is an example of this.\n3.  **Label-Preserving Augmentation:**  Maintaining label consistency during augmentation is critical to avoid harming model performance.\n4.  **Addressing Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off:** Research emphasizes techniques that enhance robustness without sacrificing accuracy on clean data.\n5.  **Beyond Adversarial Attacks:** Evaluation of robustness is expanding beyond simple adversarial attacks to include natural corruptions, distribution shifts, and anomaly detection.\n6.  **Use of Synthetic Data:** Synthetic data (like fractals in IPMix) is being explored to increase the diversity and structural complexity of training data.\n7.  **Focus on Transformers:** Future research should expand experiments with transformer architectures.\n\nIn essence, this paper reflects the current trend of using carefully designed data augmentation strategies to improve adversarial robustness and overall model safety, with an emphasis on combining different types of augmentations while maintaining label consistency and addressing the accuracy-robustness trade-off."

      "relevancy": "This paper presents STR-Cert, a robustness certification method for scene text recognition models, including Vision Transformers. The work demonstrates robustness certification on vision transformers, a development in the field of adversarial robustness for image-based prediction. It was published within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**High-Level Summary**\n\nThis paper introduces STR-Cert, a method for formally certifying the robustness of scene text recognition (STR) models, including Vision Transformers, against adversarial attacks.  While the paper focuses primarily on STR, it touches on broader trends in adversarial robustness certification and provides some valuable context even if it's not directly about image classification in general.  The core contribution is a verification technique for STR models, which are more complex than typical image classifiers due to their sequence prediction nature.\n\n**Key Information Relevant to the Research Question**\n\n*   **Focus on Certification/Verification:** The paper positions itself within the \"neural network certification\" (also called \"verification\") trend, a popular direction in robustness research. This trend aims to *prove* that a network satisfies certain properties, like robustness to adversarial perturbations.\n\n*   **Addressing Scalability & Complexity:** The paper acknowledges the challenges of scalability, precision, and support for complex models in robustness certification. It identifies that most existing methods are limited to simpler architectures (FCNNs, CNNs) and that scaling to real-world applications with complex pipelines is an ongoing challenge.\n\n*   **Vision Transformers (ViT) as a Target:** The paper explicitly targets Vision Transformers (ViT) as one of the architectures to certify. This is relevant because ViTs have become increasingly popular in image classification (and vision tasks in general) in the last few years. Certification of ViTs is therefore a current area of interest.\n\n*   **Polyhedral Abstraction:** The paper adopts a specific *verification* technique: polyhedral abstraction (based on DeepPoly). It notes that this offers a good trade-off between scalability and precision compared to other methods like semi-definite relaxations or zonotope abstraction. The paper cites CROWN and DeepPoly as early methods using polyhedral abstraction, developed further for CNNs, RNNs, and NLP Transformers.\n\n*   **Improvements in Scalability and Precision (Indirectly):** The paper mentions (in the Related Works section) that recent improvements in scalability and precision of robustness verification methods include incorporating Branch and Bound (BaB), GPU parallelism, and optimized polyhedral relaxations. This suggests ongoing research in these directions to make verification more practical.\n\n*   **Tasks Beyond Image Classification (But Relevant):** The paper notes that while most robustness verification methods are evaluated on standard image classification datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet), some research is expanding to other tasks like speech recognition, sentiment analysis, object detection/segmentation, and reinforcement learning.  This highlights a trend of applying robustness techniques to a wider range of deep learning applications.\n\n*   **Novel Softmax Bounds:** The paper includes a \"refining Softmax bounds\" section which introduces a novel polyhedral transformation that refines existing Softmax polyhedral bounds by incorporating the constraint that Softmax outputs sum to 1.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training** The paper presents a discussion of the impact of adversarial training on the performance of the STR models\n\n**Specific Details & Citations**\n\n*   **Vulnerability to Adversarial Attacks:**  Cites `[11, 60, 55]` as foundational work demonstrating the vulnerability of DNNs to adversarial attacks.\n*   **Neural Network Certification/Verification:** Mentions the aim of proving network properties like robustness `[45, 58]`, safety `[1]`.\n*   **Limitations of Existing Methods:**  Notes that scalability, precision, and support for complex models are key challenges `[22]`.\n*   **Polyhedral Abstraction Methods:** Mentions CROWN `[58]` and DeepPoly `[43]`\n*   **Improvements in Scalability/Precision:** Incorporating BaB `[49, 41]`, GPU parallelism `[29]`, and optimized polyhedral relaxations `[56]`.\n*    **Li et al. [22]** is cited for providing a taxonomy of robustness certification, which could be a useful reference for understanding the field.\n*   **Vision Transformers:**  Mentions `[42, 5, 24]` as related work achieving some progress certifying Transformers (but typically for simpler tasks). Refers to Dosovitskiy et al. `[8]` for the original Vision Transformer.\n\n**Temporal Relevance**\n\nThe paper itself seems to be recent (judging from the \"last 2 years\" constraint). It cites papers from 2018 to 2023, indicating that the field is actively developing. `[22]` is a 2023 paper, sugesting that certified robusteness for deep neural networks is an active research field\n\n**Overall Assessment**\n\nWhile this paper is primarily about STR, it provides valuable insights into the broader landscape of adversarial robustness certification, particularly regarding the challenges of scalability, the increasing importance of Vision Transformers, and the use of polyhedral abstraction techniques. The related works section gives pointers to relevant research on Transformers and other architectures."

It also evaluates robustness against a recent transformer-based attack. It was published within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Here's a detailed breakdown of the provided paper, focusing on its relevance to the research question about recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically considering papers from the last 2 years (2022-2024).\n\n**Overall Relevance:**\n\nThe paper is highly relevant.  It directly addresses adversarial robustness, focuses on Vision Transformers (ViTs) which are a relatively recent architecture, and includes experiments on adversarial attacks. It explicitly compares the adversarial robustness of a proposed multi-attribute ViT architecture (MAL-ViT) against single-attribute ViTs (SAL-ViTs). Critically, it cites and builds upon papers published within the last two years (2022 and 2021).\n\n**Key Information and Trends Extracted:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Vision Transformers (ViTs):** The paper highlights the growing interest in ViTs as alternatives to CNNs and explores their robustness. This signifies a shift in research towards understanding and improving the adversarial robustness of these newer architectures.\n\n2.  **Multi-Attribute Learning and Robustness:** A central theme is investigating the adversarial robustness of ViTs in the context of multi-attribute learning.  This is presented as a relatively unexplored area. The paper introduces a novel architecture (MAL-ViT) designed for multi-attribute learning and claims it is *more* robust than single-attribute ViTs.\n\n3.  **Vulnerability of Transformers to Token Attacks:** The paper references \"Adversarial Token Attacks on Vision Transformers\" \\[9] (Joshi et al., 2021), which indicates that ViTs are vulnerable to attacks that specifically target their token-based structure. This suggests a trend in adversarial attacks moving beyond pixel-level perturbations to manipulating the core components of transformer architectures.\n\n4.  **Patch-Based Attacks on ViTs:** The paper discusses \"Patch-Fool\" \\[5] (Fu et al., 2022), which involves identifying and perturbing the most influential patch in a ViT to cause misclassification. This highlights another trend: exploiting the patch-based processing of ViTs to craft adversarial examples. The paper then evaluates its MAL-ViT architecture against Patch-Fool.\n\n5.  **Specific Attacks Used for Evaluation:**\n    *   **FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method):**  A classic, fast, one-step adversarial attack.\n    *   **PGD (Projected Gradient Descent):**  A stronger, iterative attack where perturbations are applied iteratively to maximize the model's loss function. This is a standard benchmark for adversarial robustness.\n    *   **BIM (Basic Iterative Method):** Another iterative attack similar to PGD.\n    *   **UAP (Universal Adversarial Perturbations):**  A single, fixed perturbation that causes misclassification across multiple images.\n    *   **Patch-Fool:** A patch-based attack specifically designed for ViTs where a single, influential patch is adversarially perturbed.\n\n6.  **Findings on MAL-ViT Robustness:**  The paper consistently reports that the proposed MAL-ViT architecture exhibits *superior* robustness compared to single-attribute ViTs (SAL-ViTs) against various adversarial attacks, including FGSM, PGD, BIM, UAP, and Patch-Fool. This suggests that multi-attribute learning, when implemented effectively within a ViT, can potentially improve adversarial robustness.\n\n7.  **Effectiveness of Learnable Attribute Tokens:** The methodology section details the use of learnable attribute tokens within the MAL-ViT architecture. The experiments show that MAL-ViT with attribute tokens outperforms MAL-ViT without those tokens, indicating that these tokens are key to improved performance and robustness.\n\n8. **Quantitative Results:** Table 2 provides detailed results comparing the robust accuracy of SAL-ViT and MAL-ViT under various attacks. It provides a concrete comparison of the adversarial robustness of the two architectures. Figure 3 and Figure 5 also provide visual comparisons.\n\n**Specific Details from the Paper (to directly address the question):**\n\n*   **Architectural Level Defenses:** This research pushes for inherent robustness through architectural choices. The multi-attribute learning approach coupled with the token design intends to build robustness from the ground up, rather than relying on post-hoc adversarial training methods.\n\n*   **Focus on Attention Mechanisms:**  The paper hypothesizes that the self-attention mechanism within ViTs, specifically the interactions between attributes in MAL-ViT, contributes to its robustness. This suggests a trend in exploring how attention mechanisms can be leveraged for defense against adversarial attacks.\n\n*   **Emphasis on Balanced Accuracy:** The paper uses balanced accuracy as an evaluation metric, which is important when dealing with imbalanced datasets (which is common in attribute classification).\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions (also relevant trends):**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that UAPs (Universal Adversarial Perturbations) were less effective against ViTs compared to other attacks, suggesting that more research is needed to understand and defend against such generalized perturbations.\n*   The \"Discussion and Future Work\" section mentions plans to expand the multi-attribute learning capability of MAL-ViT to other tasks like segmentation and detection, indicating a trend towards exploring the benefits of multi-task learning for adversarial robustness across different computer vision tasks.\n\n**In summary,** this paper is a valuable resource for understanding recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification. It highlights the shift towards ViTs, the exploration of multi-attribute learning as a potential defense mechanism, and the increasing sophistication of attacks targeting the unique characteristics of transformer architectures. The paper also identifies specific attacks being used to evaluate robustness and provides empirical evidence supporting the claim that the proposed MAL-ViT architecture is more robust than single-attribute ViTs. The citations to papers from 2021 and 2022 further solidify its relevance to the specified timeframe."

It addresses the vulnerability of prompt tuning to adversarial attacks and achieves competitive robust accuracy, directly addressing the research question. It was published within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper \"ADAPT to Robustify Prompt Tuning Vision Transformers,\" here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overview of the Paper and Relevance:**\n\nThis paper focuses on improving the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) using a prompt tuning approach. While the core contribution is a novel method (ADAPT), the related works section and experimental results provide insights into recent trends in adversarial robustness, specifically within the context of ViTs and prompt tuning. Given the publication date and references, the information extracted is relevant to the last two years.\n\n**Key Trends and Methods Discussed (last two years):**\n\n*   **Prompt Tuning for Vision Transformers:** A significant trend involves adapting techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) - specifically prompt tuning - to the image classification domain using Vision Transformers. The idea is to train only a small set of \"prompt\" parameters prepended to the input of the ViT, rather than fine-tuning the entire model. This is more parameter-efficient.\n*   **Gradient Obfuscation in Prompt Tuning:** The paper highlights a vulnerability of existing prompt tuning methods: gradient obfuscation.  This means that the gradients of the model are not useful for obtaining adversarial perturbations, and training using existing methods will lead to a false sense of security.\n*   **Adaptive Adversarial Attacks:** A key trend is the development and use of adaptive attacks that are specifically designed to circumvent defenses. The paper emphasizes the need to evaluate robustness against these adaptive attacks, as standard attacks might underestimate the true vulnerability of a model. The paper demonstrates this by designing an adaptive attack tailored to the prompt tuning scenario (eq. 13).\n*   **Adversarial Training (AT) and its Variants:** Adversarial training remains a fundamental technique for improving robustness.  The paper compares its proposed ADAPT method to standard adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018), suggesting AT is still a relevant baseline.\n*   **TRADES (Zhang et al., 2019):** TRADES, which aims to balance standard accuracy and robustness by minimizing a trade-off loss, is mentioned and used as a baseline.\n*   **MART (Wang et al., 2019):** MART, which builds on top of TRADES and emphasizes on misclassified examples, is mentioned and used as a baseline.\n*   **NFGSM (de Jorge Aranda et al., 2022):** NFGSM proposes to use a high-magnitude noise perturbation and it's used as a baseline.\n*   **Black-box Attacks:**  Evaluation against black-box attacks, where the attacker has limited knowledge of the model, is a crucial trend.  The paper includes experiments using RayS and AdaEA, demonstrating the transferability of adversarial examples and the robustness of the proposed method under such constraints.\n*   **Importance of Feature Extractor Robustness:** The work suggests that for adversarial robustness in prompt tuning, it's important to consider not just the prompt tokens but also the robustness of the pre-trained feature extractor (\u03a6\u2217) of the ViT. The paper explores different prompting strategies (PT, PT2, PT+Emb, PT2+Emb) to evaluate the impact of the feature extractor.\n*   **Tuning the Embedding Layer:** The paper investigates the effect of tuning the patch embedding parameters along with the prompt tokens and the linear classifier, which shows an impact on adversarial robustness.\n\n**Details of the Proposed ADAPT Method:**\n\nWhile the research question focuses on *trends*, understanding the paper's method is helpful because it highlights how researchers are addressing these trends.\n\n*   **ADAPT (Adaptive Adversarial Prompt Tuning):** The core contribution is a new adversarial training framework specifically designed for prompt tuning.  It addresses the gradient obfuscation issue by using an adaptive adversarial attack during training.\n\n    *   **Loss Function:**  ADAPT uses a loss function that combines the standard prompt tuning loss with an adversarial loss:\n\n        *   `LADAPT = Lp(f(\u03b8p, x), y) + \u03bbLadv`\n        *   `Lp`: Standard prompt tuning loss.\n        *   `Ladv`: Adversarial loss, with options including:\n            *   Cross-Entropy (CE): `Ladv = LCE(f(\u03b8p, x'p), y)`\n            *   KL Divergence (KL): `Ladv = LKL(f(\u03b8p, x'p), f(\u03b8p, x))`\n\n*   **Adaptive Attack in ADAPT:** The key is the adaptive adversarial attack used to generate `x'p` (the adversarial example).\n    *   `x'p = x + argmax LCE(f(\u03b8p, x + \u03b4p), y) where ||\u03b4p||q\u2264\u03f5`\n    *   This attack attempts to find the perturbation `\u03b4p` within an \u2113q norm bound (\u03f5) that maximizes the cross-entropy loss, taking into account the prompt `\u03b8p`.\n\n**Experimental Results and Datasets:**\n\nThe experimental setup and results provide further context on current research.\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR10, CIFAR100\n*   **Architectures:** Vision Transformers (ViTs)\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Clean accuracy, accuracy against PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) attacks (both non-adaptive and adaptive), CW (Carlini-Wagner) attacks, AutoAttack (AA), RayS (black-box), and AdaEA (black-box).\n*   **Key Findings:**\n\n    *   Existing methods (AT, TRADES) with prompt tuning are vulnerable to adaptive attacks.\n    *   ADAPT significantly improves robustness against adaptive attacks, achieving a robust accuracy of \u223c 40% w.r.t. SOTA robustness methods using full-model fine-tuning, by tuning only \u223c 1% of the number of parameters.\n    *   Tuning the embedding layer (PT2 + Emb) along with prompt tokens further enhances robustness.\n    *   ADAPT exhibits good performance against black-box attacks.\n    *   The location and number of prompt tokens influence performance.\n\n**Specific Mentions of Relevant Papers (published in the last 2 years based on citation year):**\n\n*   **de Jorge Aranda et al., 2022:** NFGSM proposes to use a high-magnitude noise perturbation\n\n*   **Lim, 2022:** Visual prompt tuning\n*   **Touvron et al., 2022:** Train vision transformers.\n*   **Wortsman et al., 2022:** Robustness requires revisiting misclassified examples.\n*   **Nasr et al., 2023a:** An optimal transport attack for boosting adversarial transferability.\n*   **Zeng et al., 2023b:** Adversarial robustness\n*   **Lester et al., 2021:** Power of scale for parameter-efficient prompt tuning\n*   **He et al., 2022:** Masked autoencoders.\n*   **Chen et al., 2022:** Analytically tractable characterization.\n*   **Lim et al., 2022:** Visual prompt tuning.\n*   **Dong et al., 2022:** Learning to prompt for continual learning.\n*   **Bahng et al., 2022:** Exploring inter-label relations.\n*   **Xu et al., 2022:** Towards certified patch defense.\n*   **Liu et al., 2022:** An empirical study.\n*   **Xiao et al., 2022:** What makes robust generalization.\n*   **Ilyas et al., 2018:** Towards robust off-the-shelf.\n\n**In summary,** the trends in adversarial robustness for image classification as reflected in this paper (from its references and experiments) emphasize the following: (1) The rise of prompt tuning for ViTs as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning; (2) the critical need to address gradient obfuscation issues; (3) the importance of adaptive attacks in evaluating true robustness; (4) continued reliance on adversarial training techniques like TRADES; (5) evaluation using black-box attack scenarios; and (6) consideration of feature extractor robustness within the prompt tuning paradigm.

This robustness is attributed to the global receptive field of transformers.\n\n*   **Types of Attacks Considered:**\n    *   **Natural Corruptions:** The paper tests robustness against 15 common image corruptions like noise (Gaussian, shot, impulse), blur (defocus, glass, motion, zoom), weather (snow, frost, fog, brightness), and digital artifacts (contrast, elastic, pixelate, JPEG).\n    *   **Untargeted Adversarial Attacks:**  Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is used to generate adversarial examples.  The attack aims to cause general prediction errors.\n    *   **Targeted Adversarial Attacks:** These attacks are designed to induce *specific* errors, in this case, fooling the network into predicting horizontally or vertically flipped depth maps.\n\n*   **Datasets and Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   **KITTI Dataset (Eigen Split):**  Used for most robustness experiments.  RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is the primary metric for evaluating robustness.\n    *   **DDAD Dataset:** The paper also validates their findings of robustness with a different dataset, DDAD.\n    *   **Metrics:** Absolute Relative Error (Abs Rel), Squared Relative Error (Sq Rel), linear root mean squared error (RMSE), log scale invariant RMSE (RMSE log), and accuracy under thresholds (\u03b4 < 1.25, \u03b4 < 1.25<sup>2</sup>, \u03b4 < 1.25<sup>3</sup>).\n    *   For Pose Estimation, translation and rotational errors are reported for subsequences of varying lengths.\n\n*   **Architectural Choices Matter:** The paper explores different combinations of CNN/Transformer architectures for both the *depth estimation* and *pose estimation* networks.  The most robust configuration is generally found to be using transformers for *both* depth and pose estimation (MT-SfMLearner).\n\n*   **Generalizability:** Robustness of the transformers also generalize across multiple datasets and transformer encoders\n\n*   **Learning Camera Intrinsics:** The paper also investigates the impact of *learning* camera intrinsics (focal length, principal point) jointly with depth and pose.  They find that even when intrinsics are learned, transformer-based architectures maintain their robustness advantage.\n\n*   **Impact on auxiliary tasks:** Using transformers does not reduce the accuracy of pose and camera intrinsics estimations.\n\n**II. Specific Details and Experimental Results Related to Robustness:**\n\n*   **Natural Corruptions (KITTI):**  Figure 3 shows that transformer-based architectures significantly improve robustness compared to CNNs across all 15 natural corruptions at severity level 5.  RMSE is used as the metric.\n\n*   **Untargeted Attacks (KITTI):** Figure 4 demonstrates improved robustness against PGD attacks at various attack strengths (epsilon values from 0.25 to 16.0).\n\n*   **Targeted Attacks (KITTI):** Figure 5 shows improved robustness against targeted horizontal and vertical flip attacks (epsilon values 1.0, 2.0, 4.0).\n\n*   **Generalizability on DDAD Dataset:** Figures 6, 7 and 8 shows better performance of transformers with robustness againts natural corruptions and untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks.\n\n*   **Robustness with different transformer encoders (PVT vs DeiT):** Figures 9, 10 and 11 shows robustness in both PVT and DeiT, but PVT is slightly more robust, probably due to having better spatial feature pyramids.\n\n*   **Learning Intrinsics:**  Table 9 and Figure 14 show that models trained with learned intrinsics maintain comparable robustness to those trained with known intrinsics.  Transformers maintain their robustness advantage.\n\n**III. Connections to Image Classification and Potential Relevance:**\n\nThe paper explicitly mentions the following connections to image classification:\n\n*   **Transformers are Generally More Robust (in Image Classification):**  The introduction states that \"transformers have been found to be more robust for tasks such as classification [2, 45], object detection, and semantic segmentation [22]\".  This is the *motivation* for exploring transformers in SfM.\n*   **Reference to Image Classification Literature:**  The paper cites references [2, 42] regarding the robustness of transformers in image classification.  These are:\n    *   [2] Bhojanapalli et al. (2021): \"Understanding robustness of transformers for image classification\"\n    *   [42] Paul & Chen (2021): \"Vision transformers are robust learners.\"\n\n*   **Explanation for Robustness:** \"This can be attributed to their global receptive field, which allows for better adjustment to the localized deviations by accounting for the global context of the scene.\" The global context allows for better adjustment for localized deviations.\n\n**IV. Limitations and Caveats:**\n\n*   **Focus on SfM, Not Image Classification:** The *direct* relevance to image classification trends is limited. The paper's main contribution is showing that robustness benefits seen in image classification *can be transferred* to the SfM task.\n*   **Indirect Application of Image Classification Findings:** The paper does not propose *new* adversarial defense methods specifically for image classification. It leverages existing transformer architectures and applies them to SfM.\n*   **Computational Cost:** The paper acknowledges that transformers are more computationally expensive and have lower energy efficiency compared to CNNs.\n\n**In summary:** This paper doesn't directly present \"latest trends\" in *image classification* adversarial robustness. However, it *does* contribute to the broader understanding of *why* transformers are robust (global receptive field) and demonstrates that these robustness benefits can be successfully applied to related computer vision tasks like unsupervised monocular SfM and depth estimation. To get a complete picture of the latest trends for image classification specifically, you would need to consult the image classification papers cited within this document and other recent publications focused on image classification defenses."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper, addressing the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Please note:** This paper focuses on defenses against *query-based black-box attacks* specifically, using *randomized feature defense*.  While it touches on other defenses, its primary contribution and therefore its most relevant information, lies in this area.\n\n**I. Core Idea of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper proposes a defense mechanism called \"Randomized Feature Defense\" (RFD) against query-based black-box attacks.  The core idea is to inject random noise into the hidden features of a neural network at inference time.  This aims to disrupt the attacker's ability to accurately estimate gradients or search effectively for adversarial examples by providing unreliable feedback from the model.\n\n**II. Key Trends and Techniques in Adversarial Robustness (as reflected in this paper, within the last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Randomization-based Defenses:** The trend of using randomization as a defense mechanism continues to be explored. Instead of adversarial training, the aim is to introduce stochasticity into the model's behavior to confuse the attacker. This paper explicitly discusses the following randomization-based defenses:\n    *   **Random Noise Defense (RND):** Qin et al. (2021) adds Gaussian noise to the *input* for each query.\n    *   **Small Noise Defense (SND):** Byun et al. (2021) also uses additive *input* noise.\n    * **Randomized Feature Defense (RFD):** This paper's method. Instead of the input, noise is injected into the hidden features of the model.\n2.  **Emphasis on Black-Box Attack Defense:** The paper highlights the increasing relevance of black-box attack scenarios, where the attacker has no knowledge of the model architecture or parameters. This is a more realistic setting in real-world applications like Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS).\n3. **Query-Efficient Black-Box Attacks and Defenses:** There is a trend toward developing attacks that require fewer queries to the target model, given the query limitations and the desire to remain undetected (e.g., Square Attack). This paper also attempts to design a lightweight defense that doesn't significantly impact accuracy.\n4.  **Defense Against Decision-Based Attacks:** There is an emerging focus on defending against decision-based black-box attacks, where the attacker *only* receives hard label predictions (no probabilities or confidence scores). The attacks mentioned are: RayS (Chen & Gu, 2020) and SignFlip (Chen et al., 2020b).\n5.  **Adaptive Attacks:** Acknowledgment that defenses must be robust against adaptive attacks, which are designed to circumvent specific defenses. One type of adaptive attack is Expectation Over Transformation (EOT), where the attacker averages multiple queries to mitigate the effect of randomized defenses.\n6.  **Combining Defenses:** The paper explores the benefits of combining Randomized Feature Defense with Adversarial Training (AT), showing improved robustness compared to using either technique alone.\n\n**III. Details of the Proposed \"Randomized Feature Defense\" (RFD):**\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Add independent Gaussian noise to the hidden features at intermediate layers of the model during inference. The noise is sampled from N(0, \u03a3) where \u03a3 is a diagonal matrix, or N(0, \u03bdI) where \u03bd \u2208 R.\n\n*   **Theoretical Analysis:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis showing that the robustness of RFD is related to:\n    *   The ratio between the defense noise variance (\u03bd) and the attack noise variance (\u00b5).\n    *   The ratio of the norm of the gradient with respect to the hidden feature h(x) and the norm of the gradient with respect to the input x.  The model becomes more robust if the former ratio is high.\n    *   It indicates that robustness increases during the attack itself, as the data is perturbed toward adversarial samples.\n\n*   **Advantages Claimed:**\n    *   Lightweight and plug-and-play: Applicable to any pre-trained model without requiring adversarial training.\n    *   Minimal impact on clean accuracy.\n    *   Effective against both score-based and decision-based black-box attacks.\n    *   Provides both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence.\n\n*   **Algorithm (Algorithm 1 in the paper):**\n    1.  Input: A model *f*, input data *x*, noise statistics \u03a3, and a set of perturbed layers *H*.\n    2.  For each layer *hi* in the model:\n        *   If *hi* is in the set of perturbed layers *H*:\n            *   Sample noise *\u03b4* from N(0, \u03a3).\n            *   Add the noise to the layer's output:  *zi* \u2190 *hi(zi-1) + \u03b4*\n    3.  Output: The logit vector *l*.\n\n**IV. Experimental Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR10 and ImageNet.\n*   **Models:** VGG19, ResNet50, ViT (Vision Transformer), and DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer).\n*   **Attacks:**\n    *   *Score-based:* NES (Natural Evolutionary Strategies), Square Attack, SignHunt.\n    *   *Decision-based:* RayS, SignFlip.\n*   **Baselines/Comparisons:** RND, SND, AAA (Adversarial Attack on Attackers).\n*   **Evaluation Protocol:** Robustness is evaluated at hyperparameter configurations that result in a specific drop in clean accuracy (\u22481% or \u22482%), reflecting the practical need to balance robustness and performance.\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   RFD consistently achieves better robustness against Square and SignHunt attacks compared to randomized input defenses (RND, SND) on most models.\n    *   RFD is effective against decision-based attacks, whereas AAA is not.\n    *   Combining RFD with adversarial training significantly improves robustness.\n    *   The robustness correlates with the gradient norm at the randomized layer, supporting the theoretical analysis.\n    *   Adaptive attacks (EOT) can reduce the effectiveness of RFD, but RFD still provides better performance than input defenses in this scenario.\n\n**V. References to Papers Within the Last Two Years:**\n\nHere's a list of the papers cited that are from 2021 or 2022, indicating the recency of the research landscape in this area:\n\n*   Byun et al.

It proposes a novel approach, Randomized Feature Defense, provides theoretical justification, and demonstrates its effectiveness empirically, particularly when combined with adversarial training.

      "summary": "Okay, let's extract the relevant information from the paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the paper's content concerning adversarial robustness and its relevance to the research question:\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on enhancing the security of Federated Learning (FL) for image classification using Vision Transformers (ViTs). A key goal is to improve robustness against attacks that attempt to restore training images from model information shared during the FL process. The core idea is to encrypt the model parameters before sharing them with the server.\n\n**Key Aspects Related to Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   **Vulnerability of ViTs in FL:** The paper acknowledges that ViTs, despite their high performance, are particularly vulnerable to privacy attacks in FL settings. Specifically, they mention the Attention Privacy Leakage (APRIL) attack.\n*   **APRIL Attack:**  The paper specifically addresses the APRIL (Attention Privacy Leakage) attack as a significant threat. APRIL aims to reconstruct visual information of training images from updated local model information (specifically gradients). They cite Lu et al. [6] as the source for APRIL: \"APRIL: Finding the achilles\u2019 heel on privacy for vision transformers,\u201d in *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2022, pp. 10 051\u201310 060.*\n*   **Proposed Defense Mechanism:**  The paper's main contribution is a novel framework for encrypting model parameters (patch embedding and position embedding) in ViTs within an FL setting. This encryption is intended to prevent attackers (like those using APRIL) from successfully restoring training images.\n*   **Experimental Validation:**  The authors conduct experiments using the CIFAR-10 dataset and a pre-trained ViT model to evaluate their proposed method.  Crucially, they compare the results of an APRIL attack on a standard FL setup versus their encrypted FL setup.\n*   **Results Regarding APRIL:** Their results (Figure 3) show that the APRIL attack can successfully reconstruct the original image from model information in standard FL. However, when the proposed encryption method is applied, the APRIL attack fails to restore the visual information. This demonstrates the enhanced robustness against this specific attack.\n\n**Specific Details and Techniques:**\n\n*   **Model Encryption:** The core of their defense is encrypting the patch embedding (Epat) and position embedding (Epos) components of the ViT model.\n    *   *Patch Embedding Encryption:* They use a transformation matrix Ea (L x L) with randomly decided elements (but must have an inverse) to encrypt the patch embedding.  The encrypted patch embedding is then E'pat = Ea * Epat.\n    *   *Position Embedding Encryption:* A random integer vector \"lt\" is generated to permute the position embeddings, and a random matrix Eb is used to transform Epos to E'pos = Eb * Epos.\n*   **Encrypted Domain Training:** The FL aggregation (model updating) is performed directly on the encrypted model parameters.\n*   **Decryption:**  Clients decrypt the global model using the inverse of the matrices used for encryption (Ea^-1 and Eb^-1).\n*   **Federated Learning Setup:** They use FedSGD (Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent) as the aggregation algorithm within the Flower framework.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   **Focus on Privacy in Federated Learning:**  The paper highlights a growing trend of addressing privacy vulnerabilities in federated learning.  The APRIL attack demonstrates that simply using FL does not guarantee privacy; attackers can still extract information from shared model updates.\n*   **Attention-Based Models:**  The paper's focus on ViTs is relevant because attention-based models have become increasingly popular in image classification. Therefore, understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities is an active area of research.\n*   **Encryption as a Defense:**  Using encryption techniques to protect model parameters during FL is a notable trend. This paper contributes a specific encryption scheme tailored to the structure of ViTs.\n*   **Attack-Specific Defenses:** While encryption provides a general defense, the paper's evaluation against the APRIL attack shows a trend toward developing defenses that are specifically designed to counter known attack strategies.\n*   **Trade-offs:** The authors explicitly mention the trade-off between privacy protection and model performance in methods like differential privacy. Their method aims to provide enhanced security without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n**Summary of Relevant Trends:**\n\nBased on this paper, here are some trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years, particularly in the context of Federated Learning:\n\n1.  **Privacy Concerns in FL:** Acknowledgment that FL alone does not guarantee privacy, necessitating additional security measures.\n2.  **Vulnerability of Attention-Based Models:** Increasing awareness of the privacy vulnerabilities in high-performing models like Vision Transformers (ViTs).\n3.  **Gradient-Based Attacks:** Focus on attacks that exploit gradient information shared during federated learning to reconstruct private data.\n4.  **Encryption-Based Defenses:** Exploration of encryption techniques to protect model parameters and gradients during FL.\n5.  **Attack-Specific Evaluation:** Evaluating defenses against specific, known attacks (e.g., APRIL) to demonstrate their effectiveness.\n6.  **Balancing Privacy and Performance:** Aiming to develop privacy-preserving methods that minimize the impact on model accuracy.\n\n**Limitations Based on the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on robustness against *one* specific attack (APRIL). It does not evaluate the defense against a broader range of adversarial attacks.\n*   The paper's experiments are limited to the CIFAR-10 dataset.  The effectiveness of the proposed method might vary on more complex datasets.\n*   The computational overhead of the encryption/decryption process is not thoroughly discussed.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper provides valuable insights into the trend of using encryption to enhance adversarial robustness (specifically privacy) in federated learning for image classification, with a focus on Vision Transformers and the APRIL attack."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper's content relevant to the research question, focusing on adversarial robustness in image classification and considering the constraints of the last 2 years:\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThis paper does *not* directly address adversarial robustness in image classification.  Instead, it focuses on improving the robustness of *behavior-based authentication* systems (specifically, mouse-based authentication) against adversarial attacks.  It proposes a novel defense strategy using eXplainable AI (XAI), namely feature attribution methods, to select robust features.\n\n**Why It's Marginally Relevant (Despite Not Being Image Classification):**\n\nWhile the application domain is different, the *underlying concepts* of adversarial attacks and defenses are transferable. The paper explores:\n\n*   **Adversarial Attacks in a Practical Scenario:** It investigates adversarial attacks where the attacker must *physically* replicate the adversarial sample (e.g., mimicking mouse movements), introducing a discrepancy between the ideal adversarial sample and the attacker's actual behavior. This \"real-world\" constraint is a valuable consideration often missing in purely digital adversarial studies.\n*   **XAI-Based Defense Strategy:**  It proposes using feature attribution methods to identify features (mouse movements) that are *both* important for authentication and *less vulnerable* to adversarial manipulation. This is a defense strategy and the core of their contribution.\n\n**Details Extracted, Organized by Relevance:**\n\n1.  **Problem Context (Behavioral Biometrics & Adversarial Attacks):**\n\n    *   The paper addresses the vulnerability of behavior-based authentication systems (like mouse dynamics) to adversarial attacks. Traditional authentication (passwords) uses AND logic and is brittle while behavioral biometrics uses OR logic which is inherently more vulnerable. Attackers only need to manipulate a portion of the input data to deceive the authenticator.\n    *   Adversarial attacks aim to degrade the \"true positive rate\" of the authentication model.\n    *   A key challenge is that adversarial samples often fall *outside* the natural data distribution the model was trained on.\n    *   The 2024 Homeland Threat Assessment report is cited to illustrate that AI can be exploited by adversaries.\n    *   Unlike image classification, adversarial attacks in behavior biometrics are not directly fed into the classifier; the adversarial sample must be *replicated physically* by the attacker. This introduces discrepancies.\n    *   Gaussian noise is used to simulate discrepancy between the generated adversarial attack data and the real data collected from the attacker\n\n2.  **Proposed Defense: XAI-Based Feature Selection**\n\n    *   The core idea is to use XAI (specifically, feature attribution) to identify and select *robust* features.\n    *   They train a *feature selector* using the same training and testing data as the authenticator model.\n    *   The feature selector aims to:\n        *   Identify key features that define a valid user.\n        *   Eliminate redundant or irrelevant features.\n        *   Avoid selecting features that exhibit significant fluctuations (easy for attackers to mimic).\n    *   The feature selector acts as a *filter* in front of the original authenticator.\n    *   They train a feature selector that not only filters out features with minimal contribution to classification accuracy but also filters out features that are particularly susceptible to adversarial attacks in practical scenarios\n    *   Feature attribution is used to generate a feature attribution vector for each input sample quantifying the contribution of each feature to the classification decision.\n    *   The feature selector chooses the top n features for each input sample that have a greater impact on the classification outcome.\n    *   Generative model is used to handle common artifacts that may occur in conventional feature attribution methods.\n    *   The feature selector is optimized by minimizing the prediction loss associated with the selected features while maximizing the prediction loss associated with the non-selected features. This optimization approach effectively reduces the risk of information leakage through masking.\n    *   The method finds vulnerable features which the classifier boundaries in corresponding feature dimensions has larger tolerance for discrepancy and allows real world attackers to achieve low true positive rate.\n\n3.  **Methodology (Training the Feature Selector):**\n\n    *   They extend existing feature attribution methods by adding a loop to minimize prediction loss *under adversarial attack*.\n    *   During feature selector training, input adversarial samples are generated by an *adversarial sample generator* with added random Gaussian noise to simulate discrepancies.\n    *   This forces the feature selector to prioritize features that are difficult for attackers to mimic, focusing on stable and consistent patterns.\n    *   Fig. 5 provides an illustration in a two-dimensional example where the applied Gaussian noise improves the performance of the adversarial attack model by choosing to manipulate the feature that has a wider feature space between classifier boundaries.\n    *   A trade-off parameter `beta` controls the balance between prediction loss on the regular training set and the prediction loss on adversarial samples.\n\n4.  **Experiment Setup:**\n\n    *   The experiments used a mouse behavior authentication dataset [16].\n    *   21 subjects performed a predefined task of 10 consecutive mouse movements.\n    *   Data is collected as (x, y, t) coordinates, but velocity (vx, vy) is used as input.\n    *   They compare four defense strategies:\n        *   Improved Feature Selector (their method)\n        *   Basic Feature Selector\n        *   Adversarial Training\n        *   Defensive Distillation\n    *   They test two attacking scenarios: the authenticator is fully accessible, and the authenticator and feature selector are accessible.\n    *   They train 10 adversarial attack models to generate 10 movements correspondingly to maximize prediction loss.\n\n5.  **Experiment Results:**\n\n    *   The improved feature selector shows significant improvement in true positive rate against adversarial attacks compared to adversarial training and defensive distillation.\n    *   There are two trends: first, for attacking scenario 2 when both classifier and feature selector are accessible from attackers, the improvement from our method becomes less comparing to attacking scenario 1. Second, when the number of selected movements increases, the improvement from our method becomes less.\n    *   Improvement is attributed to the feature selector's ability to *avoid* selecting movements vulnerable to attacks.\n    *   The feature selector compels the attacker to mimic a less vulnerable movement.\n    *   The best performing feature selector is highly depend on the user\u2019s stable and consistent mouse behavior pattern.\n\n6.  **Related Work (and Differences):**\n\n    *   They discuss adversarial training and defensive distillation but argue that adversarial training can reduce true negative rates in behavioral biometrics.\n    *   They differentiate their approach from feature selection methods that simply reduce the feature set *without* instance-wise selection, or considering discrepancies in the data.\n\n**Limitations of Relevance to Image Classification:**\n\n*   **Domain Specificity:** The paper is very specific to behavioral biometric authentication. Direct application of the techniques to image classification might not be straightforward without adaptation.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** The evaluation focuses on true positive rate, which is appropriate for authentication but might need to be supplemented with other metrics for image classification (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\n*   **Discrepancy:**  The consideration of *physical replication* of the attack is unique to the behavioral biometric context.\n\n**In summary:** This paper, while not directly about image classification, provides insights into practical adversarial defense strategies, especially the value of XAI-driven feature selection and considering real-world constraints on attackers.  The concept of identifying and prioritizing robust features could inspire new defense approaches in image classification, but direct transfer of the methods is unlikely."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**Paper Title:** Towards Understanding and Harnessing the Effect of Image Transformation in Adversarial Detection (Published recently, making it relevant)\n\n**Overall Trend (as identified by the paper):** The paper focuses on *adversarial detection* as a reactive defense, specifically using *image transformation* techniques. It highlights a shift towards combining multiple image transformations to achieve more robust adversarial detection, addressing the limitations of individual transformation-based methods.\n\n**Key Information from the Paper:**\n\n1.  **Problem Addressed:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial detection is crucial for robust DNN-based services.\n\n2.  **Approach:** The paper investigates adversarial detection through image transformations. It synthesizes recent progress in this area, evaluates the performance of existing transformation-based detectors, and proposes a novel DNN-based approach (AdvJudge) that combines multiple image transformations.\n\n3.  **Limitations of Individual Image Transformations:** The paper emphasizes that *no single image transformation provides generic adversarial detection ability*. This is a critical finding that motivates the need for combined approaches.\n\n4.  **Proposed Solution: AdvJudge**\n    *   A DNN-based detector.\n    *   Combines scores (specifically, DKL values) from 9 different image transformations.\n    *   Learns to make judgments (benign vs. adversarial) without prior knowledge of which individual transformation scores are misleading.\n    *   Demonstrates significant improvements in detection rate compared to individual transformation-based detectors.\n\n5.  **Image Transformations Considered:**\n    *   **Pixel Modification:**\n        *   Additive Noise (Gaussian, Poisson, Salt&Pepper, Speckle)\n        *   Smoothing (Maximum, Median, Uniform, Gaussian filters)\n        *   Bit-depth Reduction\n        *   Frequency-Domain Transformation (Feature-filter - based on discrete cosine transform)\n    *   **Topological Transformation:**\n        *   Translation\n        *   Flip (Horizontal, Vertical, Both)\n        *   Rotation\n        *   Shear\n        *   Scale\n\n6.  **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   Detection Rate (Accuracy)\n    *   True Positive Rate (TPR)\n    *   True Negative Rate (TNR)\n    *   Precision\n    *   Recall\n    *   F1-Score\n    *   Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)\n\n7.  **Attacks Used for Evaluation:**\n    *   Carlini/Wagner (C&W) attacks\n    *   Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)\n    *   Basic Iterative Method (BIM)\n\n8.  **Key Findings from Experimental Evaluation of Individual Transformations:**\n    *   C&W attacks are generally more susceptible to detection by image transformations than FGSM and BIM attacks.\n    *   BIM attacks are particularly effective at evading detection by individual transformation methods.\n    *   The performance of individual transformations varies significantly, and the choice of parameters for each transformation has a large impact on detection accuracy.  There isn't a universally \"best\" single transformation.\n    *   Topological transformations are generally more effective than pixel modifications, especially against the BIM attack, however, they present lower performance for the detection of C&W attacks.\n\n9.  **AdvJudge Performance Highlights:**\n    *   F1-Score: 0.92 (significant improvement compared to individual transformations)\n    *   AUC: Up to 0.97 (higher than individual transformations across all thresholds)\n    *   Precision: 92%\n    *   Recall: 94%\n\n10. **Interpretability Analysis (using Captum):**\n    *   Identifies the relative importance of each image transformation in AdvJudge's decision-making process.\n    *   Additive noise and Shear are more correlated with benign images.\n    *   Flip had the highest influence on detecting adversarial images, while bit-depth had the lowest.\n    *   The combination of these diverse transformations enables AdvJudge to achieve a more generic detection ability.\n\n11. **Case Study:** Provides examples of false positives and false negatives, analyzing the contribution of each transformation in these specific cases to understand the failure modes of the system.\n\n12. **References:** The paper cites numerous relevant papers, including several published within the last 2 years, providing avenues for further exploration of the latest advancements in adversarial robustness (see list of references at the end).\n\n**Why This is Relevant to the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Focus on Adversarial Robustness:**  The paper directly addresses the problem of making image classification more robust against adversarial examples.\n*   **Image Transformation Trend:** It explores and advances a key trend in adversarial detection: using image transformations.\n*   **Addresses Limitations:** It acknowledges and tries to overcome the limitations of simpler, single-transformation defenses.\n*   **Recent Publication:** Its recent publication date makes the information very relevant to current research.\n*   **Combination of Methods:**  It highlights the trend of *combining* different defense mechanisms for greater robustness.\n*   **Explainability:** The inclusion of explainability analysis demonstrates a growing trend in the field to understand *why* defenses work (or don't) and how to improve them.\n*   **Evaluation Against Strong Attacks:** It evaluates against strong adversarial attacks (C&W, FGSM, BIM), indicating a focus on practical robustness.\n\nIn summary, the paper reveals a trend in adversarial robustness research that involves reactive defenses based on combining multiple image transformations. The proposed AdvJudge model demonstrates the potential of this approach, while the interpretability analysis provides insights into how these combined defenses function."

      "relevancy": "This paper explores the explainability of 1-Lipschitz neural networks and their connection to adversarial robustness. It connects robustness with explainability, which is a relevant trend.",
      "summary": "Okay, I will extract the relevant information from the paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the paper's content related to this question:\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper primarily investigates the explainability properties of 1-Lipschitz Neural Networks, specifically Optimal Transport Neural Networks (OTNNs), rather than directly focusing on *new* adversarial robustness techniques. However, it *does* touch on the relationship between 1-Lipschitz networks and robustness, and how their gradients relate to adversarial attacks.\n\n**II. Key Points Relevant to Adversarial Robustness (and Trends, though not a central *new* contribution in robustness itself):**\n\n1.  **1-Lipschitz Networks and Certifiable Robustness:** The paper highlights that 1-Lipschitz neural networks (specifically OTNNs) are known to be *certifiably robust by design*. This means there are mathematical guarantees on their robustness against adversarial attacks, a property that's been explored in previous work (citations [32, 49]). The \"trend\" here is the *continued* interest in 1-Lipschitz networks as a way to achieve robustness.  The paper mentions \"certifiable robustness guarantees [32, 49], improve the generalizations [62] and the interpretability of the model [67]\".\n\n2.  **Optimal Transport Neural Networks (OTNNs):** OTNNs are trained using the dual loss of an optimal transport optimization problem. This training approach (hKR loss) is cited as a method to achieve robustness with a certifiable margin [56]. This implies that using optimal transport as a training objective is a relevant approach, linking robustness to a well-defined mathematical framework. This approach was introduced in 2021.\n\n3.  **Adversarial Attacks as Counterfactual Explanations:** A significant point is the reinterpretation of adversarial attacks on OTNNs. The paper demonstrates that, for OTNNs, adversarial attacks are *equivalent* to traversing the optimal transport path between classes.  Following the gradient of an OTNN is no longer just an attack, but a \"counterfactual explanation\" showing how to transform an input from one class to another.  This is an interesting perspective, suggesting that robust models can also provide inherently explainable adversarial perturbations. This is achieved because \"the gradient of the optimal solution at a given point x is both (i) in the direction of the nearest adversarial example on the decision boundary, and (ii) in the direction of the image of x according to the underlying transport plan.\"\n\n4.  **OTNN Gradients and Adversarial Examples:** The paper states that for OTNNs, adversarial examples are precisely identified, and the direction is given by the gradient, and the distance is given by the absolute value of the network output. This aligns adversarial attacks with the gradient direction, making them similar to Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attacks. It states that \"all attacks, such as PGD [45] or Carlini and Wagner [13], applied on an OTNN model, were equivalent to FGSM attacks\".\n\n5.  **Empirical Validation:**  The paper's experiments provide empirical evidence supporting the theoretical claims.  While the primary focus is on explainability metrics, the fact that OTNNs achieve comparable classification performance to unconstrained networks *while also* exhibiting these interesting gradient properties is relevant to the broader goal of achieving robustness without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n6.  **Limitations (Implied):** The paper hints at the computational cost of training OTNNs (3-6 times longer than unconstrained networks) as a potential drawback. However, it mentions that inference costs are similar.\n\n7.  **Related Work:** The related work section mentions several techniques used to enforce the 1-Lipschitz constraint, such as Frobenius normalization [54], spectral normalization [46], and orthogonalization [41, 1, 66, 6]. It also refers to Wasserstein GANs [7] as an earlier example of using optimal transport in neural networks.\n\n**III. Specific Citations Relevant to Robustness Trends (within the last 2 years AND slightly older seminal papers):**\n\n*   **[56] M. Serrurier et al. (2021):**  This is the foundational paper on OTNNs with hinge regularization. It's crucial because it establishes the certifiable robustness margin of these networks.\n*   **[32] M. Hein and M. Andriushchenko (2017):** Formal Guarantees on the Robustness of a Classifier against Adversarial Manipulation. Establishes formal guarantees on robustness.\n*   **[49] H. Ono et al.

Spectral normalization enforces the Lipschitz constant of each layer of the neural network.\n\n**IV.  Synthesis of Information Regarding the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Trend:** 1-Lipschitz neural networks remain an area of interest for achieving provable robustness against adversarial attacks.\n*   **Approach:**  Training with optimal transport-based losses (like the hKR loss) is a viable method to create robust classifiers, and this approach offers an interesting connection between robustness and explainability.\n*   **Insight:** Adversarial attacks on well-designed (OTNN) robust networks can be reinterpreted as counterfactual explanations, providing insights into how to change a model's decision.\n*   **Limitation:**  Training 1-Lipschitz networks, especially OTNNs, can be computationally expensive.\n\n**In summary, while this paper doesn't introduce a completely *new* adversarial defense method, it contributes to the ongoing trend of using 1-Lipschitz constraints for robustness, highlights the potential of optimal transport-based training, and offers a novel perspective on adversarial examples as counterfactual explanations within the framework of OTNNs.**\n\nIt is important to note that many of the citations are older than 2 years, but the core contribution of *this specific paper* builds upon and extends these earlier findings within the specified timeframe."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Relevance:**\n\nThis paper is **NOT relevant** to the stated research question.  It does *not* deal with image classification or specifically address adversarial robustness in that context.  Instead, it focuses on *data poisoning attacks on off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) methods* in reinforcement learning (RL). The application domain is primarily healthcare and control systems, not image classification.\n\n**Why It's Not Relevant (In Detail):**\n\n*   **Core Topic:** The paper's central theme is the vulnerability of OPE methods to data poisoning attacks. The goal is to manipulate the training data of OPE algorithms to cause errors in policy value estimation, potentially leading to incorrect decisions in domains like healthcare.\n*   **Adversarial Attacks (Context):**  The *type* of adversarial attack explored is *data poisoning*, where the training data is subtly modified to degrade performance.  This contrasts with *adversarial examples* common in image classification, where carefully crafted input images are designed to fool a trained classifier.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning Focus:** The paper is deeply rooted in the concepts and methods of reinforcement learning, particularly off-policy evaluation. It discusses MDPs, policies, value functions, importance sampling, Bellman equations, etc. These concepts are not directly related to standard image classification tasks.\n*   **Healthcare Application:**  The experiments involve datasets related to healthcare (Cancer, HIV) and control systems (Mountain Car, Cartpole, Continuous Gridworld). Image datasets are not mentioned.\n*   **OPE methods attacked:** The paper analyses the sensitivity of Bellman Residual Minimization (BRM) [Farahmand et al., 2008], Weighted Importance Sampling (WIS), Weighted Per-Decision Importance Sampling (PDIS) [Precup, 2000, Powell and Swann, 1966, Rubinstein, 1981], Consistent PerDecision Importance Sampling (CPDIS) [Thomas, 2015], and Weighted Doubly Robust methods (WDR) [Jiang and Li, 2016].

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper and extract the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis paper primarily focuses on *data poisoning attacks* against *fair representation learning (FRL)* models, *not* image classification models directly. While it touches upon adversarial robustness, it's within the specific context of fairness and representation learning. **Therefore, this paper has limited direct relevance to the research question about adversarial robustness in *image classification*.**\n\nHowever, there are some general points that might be helpful for understanding broader trends in adversarial robustness, particularly in how attacks are designed and evaluated.\n\n**Key Relevant Information (with caveats):**\n\n1.  **Type of Adversarial Attack:**\n    *   **Data Poisoning Attack:** The paper investigates data poisoning attacks, where the attacker injects carefully crafted \"poisoned\" samples into the training data to degrade model performance (specifically, to make the representations unfair).\n    *   **Clean-Label Attack:**  The attack is a \"clean-label\" attack, meaning the attacker only modifies the features of the poisoned samples but *not* the labels. This makes the attack more stealthy and difficult to detect.\n\n2.  **Attack Goal:**\n    *   The goal is to make the learned *representations* unfair by maximizing the *mutual information (MI)* between the learned representations and sensitive demographic features (e.g., gender, age).  This is achieved by making the representations contain as much demographic information as possible.\n    *   The paper connects this MI maximization with demographic parity, one of the most popular fairness notions. The authors state that this is one of the most significant contributions of their work.\n\n3.  **Attack Methodology:**\n    *   **Bilevel Optimization:** The attack involves a challenging bilevel optimization problem. The outer level aims to maximize the MI between representations and sensitive features. The inner level involves training the fair representation learning model on the poisoned data.\n    *   **Approximation:** The paper proposes an *approximate* solution to the bilevel optimization problem:\n        *   **FLD (Fisher's Linear Discriminant):** Uses Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) score as a proxy for maximizing MI.\n        *   **Gradient Matching (GradMatch):** Employs a gradient matching technique (inspired by Geiping et al., 2020, \"Witches' Brew\") to align the gradients of the upper-level objective (FLD score) and the lower-level loss function of the FRL model.  This helps to determine how to perturb the training data to achieve the attack goal.\n        *   **Elastic-Net Regularization:** Introduces elastic-net regularization to promote sparsity in the perturbations, enhancing the stealthiness of the attack. This means perturbing only a few dimensions.\n\n4.  **Theoretical Analysis:**\n    *   The paper includes a theoretical analysis of the *minimal number of poisoning samples* required for gradient-matching-based attacks to succeed. This is a potentially valuable contribution applicable to other gradient-matching attacks as well. This analysis relates the number of poisoning samples to factors like learning rate, batch size, and the magnitude of gradients.\n\n5.  **Experimental Results:**\n    *   The attack is evaluated on four FRL models and two benchmark fairness datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed attack is effective in degrading fairness, even with a small percentage of poisoned data.\n\n6.  **Baselines:**\n    *   The paper compares against variants of \"anchor attacks,\" a heuristic approach for poisoning fair machine learning models. The proposed attack outperforms these baselines.\n\n7.  **Defense Considerations:**\n    *   The theoretical analysis provides insights into potential defense strategies.  One suggestion is to reduce the batch size during training, which can make the attack more difficult. The paper mentions adding noise to gradients as a defense against GradMatch (verified in Geiping et al., 2020).\n\n8.  **Related Work:**\n    *   The paper discusses related work in fair representation learning and data poisoning attacks, providing context for the proposed method. It contrasts the proposed approach with existing attacks on classical fair machine learning methods and highlights the challenges of attacking deep learning-based FRL.\n\n**Why this is *not* directly relevant to image classification robustness:**\n\n*   **Focus on Fairness:**  The primary objective is to compromise the fairness of representations, not necessarily to reduce the *overall accuracy* of a classification task in the same way that a typical adversarial attack on image classification does. While fairness and robustness are related, they are distinct concepts.\n\n*   **Data Type:** The experiments are conducted on tabular datasets (Adult, German), not image datasets. The attack is designed for features that represent pre-processed data, unlike most image classification attacks that directly manipulate pixel values.\n\n*   **FRL-Specific Techniques:** The use of mutual information and Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) score is specifically tailored to the goals of fair representation learning and may not be directly applicable to image classification problems.\n\n*   **Gradient Matching Context:** While the use of gradient matching is a technique that *could* be used in image classification attacks, the paper's analysis and implementation are specific to the fairness context.\n\n**In summary:** This paper is valuable for understanding data poisoning attacks in the context of *fairness* and *representation learning*.  It provides insights into attack design, optimization techniques, and theoretical analysis that *might* be transferable to other adversarial settings, including image classification.  However, its direct applicability to the stated research question is limited."

      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided paper and extracted the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Summary of Relevant Information:**\n\nBased on the provided document, there is **no direct information** about \"adversarial robustness for image classification\" or \"image classification\" in general. The paper focuses on a completely different domain: **data poisoning attacks on Matrix Factorization (MF) based Recommender Systems (RS)**.\n\nHowever, the paper DOES touch upon some concepts that could be *loosely* related to adversarial robustness, even though it's in the context of recommender systems:\n\n*   **Adversarial Attacks (Data Poisoning):** The core of the paper revolves around analyzing how an adversary can inject malicious data (fake user profiles with crafted ratings) into a recommender system to manipulate its behavior, specifically to promote an item to a targeted group of users. This is analogous to adversarial attacks in image classification, where subtle perturbations to an image can fool a classifier.\n\n*   **Targeted Attacks:** The research focuses on attacks that target *specific user clusters*. This concept is similar to targeted adversarial attacks in image classification, where the goal is to misclassify an image as a specific, chosen class.\n\n*   **Robustness Analysis:** The paper aims to understand how these data poisoning attacks affect the latent feature matrices (U and V) in MF-based RS. This is akin to studying the robustness of a machine learning model's internal representations to adversarial examples. The authors investigate how changes in these matrices enable the attacks.\n\n*   **Defense Mechanisms:**  The paper briefly discusses potential defense mechanisms against data poisoning attacks in recommender systems. These include:\n    *   Increasing true ratings to items.\n    *   Updating the item matrix less frequently.\n    *   Detecting shifts in item vectors.\n\n*   **Relevance of Matrix Factorization:** Mentions that the foundational technique of Matrix Factorization (MF) is worth exploring under attack.\n\n**Why this paper is *NOT* directly relevant (despite the parallels):**\n\n*   **Different Domain:** The key point is that this paper is about *recommender systems*, not *image classification*. The techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics are all tailored to the recommender system domain.\n*   **No Image Data:**  There is no mention of images, pixels, convolutional neural networks, or any of the typical components of image classification.\n*   **Focus on Data Poisoning, not Adversarial Examples:** The paper addresses data poisoning, which is a type of attack on the training data.  Adversarial robustness in image classification typically deals with attacks *at inference time* (adversarial examples).\n*   **Limited Scope:**  The paper does not present novel defense mechanisms.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nWhile the paper explores adversarial attacks and robustness, it does so within the context of recommender systems and matrix factorization. Therefore, it does **not** provide any information about the latest trends in adversarial robustness *for image classification*. It is outside the scope of the research question."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to the research question:\n\n**Research Question:** What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**Relevant Information from the Provided Paper (Published in 2023):**\n\nWhile the primary focus of this paper is on \"Universal Backdoor Attacks\" rather than adversarial robustness in general, it *does* touch upon the topic of *defenses against backdoor attacks*, which is a relevant sub-area of adversarial robustness.  Specifically, it investigates the robustness of a novel backdoor attack against several existing defense mechanisms.\n\nHere's what the paper says that directly relates to adversarial robustness trends (specifically defense trends against backdoor attacks), focusing on the last 2 years (approximately):\n\n1.  **Defense Strategies Evaluated:** The paper evaluates its universal backdoor attack against the following state-of-the-art defenses. Because the paper was published in 2023, these represent relatively recent defense strategies:\n\n    *   **Fine-tuning:**  This involves fine-tuning the model on a small, validated dataset assumed to be free of poisoned samples.  The model is often regularized with weight decay during this process to remove potential backdoors.\n    *   **Fine-pruning:**  A variation of fine-tuning. It prunes convolutional filters that do not activate on clean inputs from a trusted dataset, and the resulting model is fine-tuned. (Liu et al., 2018 is cited, but the paper's evaluation of this defense is current).\n    *   **Neural Cleanse:**  This defense aims to reverse-engineer the trigger pattern of a backdoor for any target class.  It then removes the backdoor by fine-tuning the model on image-label pairs containing the reversed-engineered triggers.  (Wang et al., 2019 is cited).\n    *   **Neural Attention Distillation (NAD):** This involves aligning the intermediate feature maps of a potentially backdoored (student) model with those of a teacher model fine-tuned on a trusted dataset. (Li et al., 2021 is cited).\n\n2.  **Robustness Findings:**  A key finding is that existing defenses are *ineffective* against the proposed \"Universal Backdoor Attacks.\" The paper states, \"Finally, we show that existing defenses are ineffective at defending against Universal Backdoors, indicating the need for new defenses designed to remove backdoors that target many classes.\"\n\n    *Table 3 summarizes the results of experiments evaluating the robustness of the universal backdoor against defenses. It shows the attack success rate (ASR) before and after applying each defense for different numbers of poison samples. The universal backdoor generally maintains a high ASR even after applying defenses, indicating its robustness.*\n    * The fine-tuning defence reduced ASR by only 1 - 10% depending on the number of poison samples\n    * The fine-pruning defence reduced ASR by only 0.1 - 6.6% depending on the number of poison samples\n    * The Neural Cleanse defence reduced ASR by only 0.3 - 10% depending on the number of poison samples\n    * The Neural Attention Distillation defence reduced ASR by only 0.4 - 6.2% depending on the number of poison samples\n\n3.  **Clean Data Trade-off:** The paper acknowledges the known trade-off between the amount of clean data available and the effectiveness of defenses (Li et al., 2021).  They specifically measure the proportion of the clean dataset needed to remove the universal backdoor using fine-tuning without significantly degrading the model's accuracy.  The finding is that a substantial portion of the clean dataset (approximately 40%) is needed to completely remove the backdoor.\n\n4.  **Limitations of Data Sanitation Defenses:** The paper discusses the limitations of data sanitization defenses. SPECTRE (Hayase et al., 2021) is not effective against Universal Backdoors because it only removes samples from a single class. STRIP (Gao et al., 2019) has a high false positive rate.\n\n**Implications for Adversarial Robustness Trends:**\n\n*   The research highlights a vulnerability of image classification models to universal backdoor attacks that can target every class.\n*   It suggests that current defense mechanisms are not well-equipped to handle such attacks, especially when the attacker can control even a small percentage of the training data.\n*   The paper stresses the need for new, more robust defense strategies specifically designed to counter backdoor attacks that target multiple classes.\n* The study advocates for protecting the entire dataset, instead of individual classes.\n\n**Key Takeaways Regarding Recent Trends:**\n\nBased on this paper (and the cited works), some emerging trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (specifically regarding defenses against backdoor attacks) include:\n\n*   **Continued use of fine-tuning and pruning-based defenses:** These remain popular, but this paper shows they have limitations against more sophisticated attacks.\n*   **Attention-based defenses:** Neural Attention Distillation (NAD) represents a trend towards using attention mechanisms to detect and mitigate backdoors.\n*   **The recognition of the clean data trade-off:** The community is aware that the effectiveness of many defenses is heavily reliant on access to a clean, validated dataset, which is often difficult or expensive to obtain in practice.\n*   **A shift towards holistic dataset protection:** There's a growing realization that defending against data poisoning requires protecting the integrity of the *entire* dataset, not just individual classes or high-value samples.\n* **Limitations of Data Sanitation Defenses:** Data sanitation defences, such as SPECTRE and STRIP, have limitations when used to defend against backdoor attacks.\n\n**Important Note:** This paper is *focused* on backdoor attacks and defenses *against them*. Therefore, while it provides some insights into the broader landscape of adversarial robustness, it doesn't cover all the latest trends in general adversarial example defenses."

This suggests a trend towards using optimization techniques that don't require gradient information.\n\n    *   The paper distinguishes DevoPatch from other evolutionary methods by its careful design for the integer domain and its focus on query efficiency for patch attacks.\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Solution Space:**  The trend to improve query efficiency by simplifying the solution space. The paper explicitly calls out the complex solution space for patch attacks and offers a method to simplify it.\n\n    *   The paper models patches using paired key-points and uses targeted images as the initialization of patches, which reduces the search complexity.\n\n6.  **Vulnerability to patch attacks:** The paper highlights the vulnerability of DNN models to patch attacks and identifies that this can be exploited through adversarial attacks.\n\n7.  **Patch Defense Mechanisms:** The paper explores the effectiveness of existing patch defense mechanisms and discovers some deficiencies of the existing methods.\n\n**Key Contributions of the Paper**\n\n*   **First Exploration of Decision-Based Patch Attacks:** The paper claims to be the first to explore the decision-based patch attack setting in detail.\n*   **DevoPatch Algorithm:** The development of a novel evolutionary algorithm (DevoPatch) tailored for query-efficient decision-based patch attacks.\n*   **Vulnerability Evaluation of ViT and MLP:** The evaluation of the adversarial robustness of ViT and MLP models against patch attacks in the decision-based black-box setting.\n*   **Empirical Results:** Comprehensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of DevoPatch compared to existing methods.\n\n**Important Details about DevoPatch**\n\n*   It's a query-efficient, decision-based, black-box patch attack algorithm.\n*   It uses a differential evolutionary algorithm.\n*   It models patches using paired key-points.\n*   It uses targeted images as the initialization of patches.\n*   Parameter optimizations are performed on the integer domain.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on image classification and face verification tasks.\n*   The study uses specific models (ResNet, ViT, MLP) and datasets (ILSVRC2012, LFW, CelebA). Generalizability to other models and datasets should be considered.\n*   The paper only examines the models that are the victim of the attack. The success of the attack depends on the target model.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe paper contributes to the understanding of adversarial robustness by focusing on a practical and challenging attack scenario (decision-based black-box patch attacks). It also provides insights into the vulnerability of modern DNN architectures (ViT and MLP) and introduces a query-efficient attack method. This paper identifies vulnerabilities that are of current interest in the field."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper, specifically focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years, as of the paper's writing (which appears to be in 2023 or 2024 based on the references).\n\n**I. General Trends & Context (based on the introduction and related works)**\n\n*   **Adversarial Patch Attacks are a Significant Threat:** The paper emphasizes that adversarial patch attacks are a major concern for deploying deep learning systems in real-world applications. These attacks involve adding localized, often small, patches to images that can cause misclassification.\n*   **Limitations of Existing Defenses:** The paper points out that many existing defenses, particularly those based on image pre-processing, often reduce accuracy on clean (unattacked) images and are not always effective against *physically* realizable attacks. There's a need for defenses that are robust *and* maintain good performance on clean images.\n*   **Anomaly Detection as a Strategy:**  A key trend identified is the idea of treating adversarial patches as *anomalies* or outliers within the image data distribution. This motivates the use of anomaly detection techniques to identify and isolate these patches.\n*   **Move towards Model-Agnostic Defenses:** There is a trend and a need for defense mechanisms that are not specific to one particular model architecture but can be applied across different models.\n*   **Two Categories of Defenses:** Defenses can be categorized as Certified and Empirical.\n\n**II. The Paper's Contribution (as a potential trendsetter)**\n\nThis paper contributes to the trend of anomaly-detection based defenses with a specific focus on patch attacks. Here's a breakdown of their approach:\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Treat adversarial patches as anomalies.\n*   **Proposed Defense Mechanism:** A three-stage pipeline called \"Segmenting, Isolating, and Blocking.\"\n    *   **Segmenting Phase:** Divides the image into overlapping segments using a moving window (kernel).\n    *   **Isolating Phase:** Uses the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to identify segments that contain adversarial noise (anomalies). DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that's good at finding clusters of data points in noisy data.\n    *   **Blocking Phase:** Neutralizes the adversarial patch by replacing the pixels in the identified segments with the *mean pixel value* of the image. The authors found mean replacement to be superior to min/max replacement.\n*   **Model-Agnostic:** The defense is designed to work across different neural network architectures.\n*   **Performance:** Claims to achieve up to 85% recovery on adversarial samples in image classification tasks across datasets, adversarial patches, and neural architectures.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper focuses on \"robust accuracy\" \u2013 the accuracy of the model *with* the defense in place against adversarial attacks.\n\n**III. Specifics on Datasets, Attacks, and Models used for Evaluation (Important for comparing with other research)**\n\n*   **Datasets:**\n    *   **ImageNet:**  A large, widely used dataset for image classification.\n    *   **Caltech-101:** A smaller dataset, also used for image classification.\n*   **Models:**\n    *   **ResNet-50:** A popular residual network architecture.\n    *   **ResNet-152:** A deeper version of ResNet.\n    *   **VGG-19:**  An older, but still relevant, convolutional neural network architecture.\n*   **Attacks:**\n    *   **LaVAN (Localized and Visible Adversarial Noise):**  Generates localized patches. In this paper, the LaVAN patch is placed in the upper left corner.\n    *   **GoogleAp (Google Adversarial Patch):**  Generates universal patches that can be applied at various locations in the image. GoogleAp uses Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) to improve robustness.\n*   **Patch Sizes:**  Evaluated with patch sizes ranging from 38x38 to 50x50 pixels.\n*   **Implementation Details:**\n    *   Kernel size for segmenting phase: 40x40\n    *   Stride length for segmenting phase: 8 pixels\n    *   DBSCAN parameters: eps = 0.4, minPts = 1201\n\n**IV. Performance and Comparisons (Key for assessing the state-of-the-art)**\n\n*   **Quantitative Results:** The paper presents tables of robust accuracy for different models, datasets, and patch sizes (see Tables I-IV in the original text). Key takeaway:  The defense significantly improves accuracy compared to having *no* defense against the patch attacks.\n*   **Comparison to State-of-the-Art (SOTA):**  The paper compares its defense against:\n    *   **LGS (Localized Gradient Smoothing) [1]:**  A defense that normalizes gradient values.\n    *   **Jujutsu [2]:** A two-stage defense against adversarial patch attacks. (Published in 2023)\n    *   **De-randomized Smoothing (DS) [15]:** A certified defense based on ensembling local predictions.\n    *   **PatchGuard [14]:** A provably robust defense against adversarial patches using small receptive fields and masking.\n*   **Claim:**  The paper claims to *outperform* these SOTA defenses, achieving a robust accuracy of 67.1% on ImageNet with ResNet-50 against GoogleAp attacks, compared to 53.86% for LGS and 60% for Jujutsu.\n\n**V. Adaptive Attack (Testing the Defense's Limits)**\n\n*   **Attempted Adaptive Attack:** The authors explored an adaptive attack where the adversarial patch is designed to have a data distribution similar to clean image segments.\n*   **Method:** The adaptive attack constrains the mean and standard deviation of the patch's color channels to be similar to that of random fragments from clean images.\n*   **Result:** This adaptive attack made it *more difficult* to isolate the patch as an anomaly, *but* the attack's effectiveness was *limited.* The model accuracy only decreased from 78% to 67%, suggesting the defense still provided some level of robustness.\n\n**VI. Key Takeaways and Potential Future Directions (Inferred from the Conclusion)**\n\n*   **Anomaly Detection is Promising:** The paper reinforces the idea that anomaly detection techniques are a viable approach for defending against adversarial patch attacks.\n*   **Future Work:**\n    *   Developing stronger anomaly detection techniques.\n    *   Extending the defense mechanism to other computer vision tasks beyond image classification.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper contributes to the trend of using anomaly detection for adversarial defense, specifically against patch attacks.  It proposes a three-stage defense mechanism based on segmentation and DBSCAN clustering. The results suggest this approach is effective and can outperform existing defenses, but further research is needed to improve robustness against adaptive attacks and extend the approach to other tasks. The paper highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing robustness against adversarial attacks with maintaining accuracy on clean images. The inclusion of the \"Jujutsu\" defense (from 2023) suggests that research on patch attack defenses is an active area of investigation."

      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided research paper and extracted the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed summary of the relevant content, focusing on trends and recent developments (within the implied timeframe of 2022-2024, given the publication date of Dec 2024):\n\n**Overall Trend:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on **adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs)**, which have become prominent in image classification, challenging traditional CNNs.  The trend is shifting toward understanding and defending against adversarial attacks on these newer architectures.\n\n**Specific Trends & Findings (from the paper):**\n\n1.  **Vulnerability of ViTs:**\n    *   ViTs, while initially thought to be more robust than CNNs, are still **vulnerable to adversarial attacks**, including both L_p_ norm attacks and, significantly, **patch attacks**.\n    *   The paper explicitly states that **ViTs are *more* vulnerable to patch attacks than CNNs** because these attacks can easily misdirect the attention mechanism of ViTs. This highlights a crucial area of concern specific to ViT-based models.\n\n2.  **Patch Attacks Gaining Importance:**\n    *   The paper notes a trend where **patch attacks are being recognized as a more practical and serious threat** in real-world scenarios than traditional L_p_ norm attacks.  Examples like attaching adversarial patches to stop signs are given. This suggests a growing focus on defenses against localized, real-world adversarial threats.\n\n3.  **Inadequacy of Existing Defenses (Designed for CNNs):**\n    *   **Traditional detection methods designed for CNNs are often impractical or suffer significant performance degradation when applied to ViTs** due to the architectural differences.  They also often **overlook patch attacks**, a major weakness against ViTs. This creates a need for new defense mechanisms tailored to ViTs.\n\n4.  **Defense Strategies for ViTs (Overview):**\n    *   Current efforts to improve ViT robustness are focused on:\n        *   **Data augmentation** (e.g., [18] - Chen et al., 2022)\n        *   **Adversarial training** (e.g., [53] - Mo et al., 2022)\n        *   **Attention mechanism modification** (e.g., [27] - Gu et al., 2022; [51] - Mao et al., 2022; [92] - Zhou et al., 2022)\n        *   **Ensemble strategies** (e.g., [50] - Mahmood et al., 2021)\n    *   A key drawback of many of these methods is that they **require architecture modifications or retraining** of the ViT model.\n\n5.  **Lack of ViT-Specific Detection Methods:**\n    *   There's a **lack of ViT-specific detection methods for L_p_ norm attacks.** This is a gap the paper aims to address.\n    *   For patch attacks, the paper cites ARMRO [42] (Liu et al., 2023) as a state-of-the-art defense, which detects and masks suspicious patches.  However, the paper argues for a need for methods that detect adversarial *examples* rather than just patches.\n\n6.  **ViTGuard: A Proposed Defense (This paper's contribution):**\n    *   The paper introduces **ViTGuard, a detection method designed specifically for ViTs to counter both L_p_ norm and patch attacks.** The key components are:\n        *   **Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for image reconstruction:** This reconstructs randomly masked patches, providing a flexible image recovery strategy without needing adversarial examples during training. (He et al., 2022, [29])\n        *   **Attention-aware and CLS token-aware detectors:** These leverage distinctive ViT features to distinguish between normal and adversarial samples.\n    *   ViTGuard aims to be a **general mechanism that can be applied in tandem with existing ViT models without modification or retraining.**\n    *   It's designed to be effective against unseen attacks (generalizable).\n    *   The detectors use L2 distance between attention maps and CLS representations of original and reconstructed images as a metric.\n    *   The MAE uses random masking strategy.\n    *   The paper explores generalizability on DeiT and CaiT.\n\n7.  **Adaptive Attacks & Evasion:**\n    *   The paper also considers the trend of **attackers adapting to defenses**.  It demonstrates that ViTGuard shows robustness even against adaptive attacks where the attacker has full knowledge of the detection mechanism. The random masking strategy makes it harder for attackers to craft successful adversarial examples.\n\n**Specific Papers Referenced (and their relevance):**\n\n*   **[22] Dosovitskiy et al.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last two years (2022-2024, given the context of the paper).  I'll break it down into key areas:\n\n**I. Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper investigates adversarial patch attacks on object detection and classification models, specifically targeting physical-world attacks.\n*   It proposes and evaluates a defense mechanism based on inpainting techniques.\n*   The research aims to enhance the robustness and reliability of AI models in the face of adversarial threats.\n\n**II. Key Trends and Techniques Discussed (within the scope of the research question):**\n\n1.  **Adversarial Patch Attacks:**\n\n    *   **Focus on Physical Attacks:** The paper emphasizes defenses against *physical* adversarial patch attacks, reflecting a trend towards real-world applicability of adversarial robustness research. This is important because many earlier studies focused solely on digital attacks.\n    *   **Patch Location Importance:** A key finding is that, for object detection models, the *location* of the adversarial patch is often more critical than its shape or texture. This insight simplifies the design of physical attacks and suggests that defenses need to be particularly sensitive to spatial disturbances.\n    *   **Targeted vs. Universal Patches:** The paper explores both targeted (specific to a class) and universal (effective across various backgrounds) adversarial patches. It notes the challenge that universal patches often require altering every pixel in the image, making them less practical for physical attacks.  The authors' approach focuses on a *localized* patch.\n    *   **Camouflaged Patches:** The paper explores the concept of camouflaged patches, which are compelled to resemble a specified initial image, by introducing a constraint in the form of  ||\ud835\udc5d \u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54||\u221e < \ud835\udf00  within the patch optimization objective. This constraint ensures that the resulting patch remains within an \ud835\udf00 distance in the \ud835\udc3f\u221e norm of a given starting patch, denoted as\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54.\n\n2.  **Defense Mechanisms (Inpainting-Based):**\n\n    *   **Inpainting as a Defense:** The primary defense strategy explored is *inpainting*, where the adversarial patch region is identified and filled in using information from surrounding pixels.  This is a form of data modification as a defense, as classified in the paper itself.\n    *   **Fast Marching Method (FMM):** The paper uses the Fast Marching Method (FMM) algorithm for inpainting. FMM is efficient for computing shortest paths, making it well-suited for reconstructing damaged regions in images. This involves repopulating damaged regions with a normalized weighted sum derived from known pixels in the vicinity of the target area.\n    *   **Masking:** A crucial step is the creation of an inpainting mask, explicitly delineating target image areas requiring restoration, marked by the presence of non-zero pixels.\n    *   **Differential Algorithm:** The paper used differential algorithm to create set of paired images: the original image, captured prior to the patch attack and the second including the patch attack. Subtracted the image pixel values to identify a mask specifically delineating the patch spatial coordinates.\n    *   **Restoration of Confidence Levels:**  The success of the inpainting defense is measured by its ability to restore the model's confidence level in its original classification.\n\n3.  **Model and Dataset Choices:**\n\n    *   **YOLOv5:** The paper utilizes YOLOv5 for object detection and classification, reflecting the popularity of this model in real-time applications.\n    *   **CNN with GTSRB:** A CNN is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, to analyze adversarial attacks on traffic sign classification.\n    *   **Custom Dataset:**  The authors also use a custom dataset to evaluate their methods.\n\n4.  **Evaluation Metrics:**\n\n    *   **Accuracy, Precision, and Recall:** Standard metrics for classification performance are used.\n    *   **Box Loss:** For object detection, the accuracy of bounding box predictions is evaluated using box loss.\n    *   **Ratio of Unsuccessfully Defended Attacks:** A key metric, defined as `ratio = [unsuccessfully defended attack] / overall attacked data`. This quantifies the effectiveness of the defense.\n    *    **Magnitude of Perturbations per Number of Queries Required:** The authors define a ratio \u03b1 =  ||\ud835\udc4b[\u0302]\u2212\ud835\udc4b||\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5d / \ud835\udc41 , whereas \ud835\udc4b is the original input, \ud835\udc4b[\u0302] is the input with adversarial perturbations and \ud835\udc41 is the number of inquiries that were required to do to calculate \ud835\udc4b.\n\n5.  **Activation Functions:**\n\n    *   The paper explores the influence of non-linear activation functions on the robustness of AI models to adversarial patch attacks, observing that the model employing the ReLU piecewise linear activation function displays a higher susceptibility to the adversarial patch attack.\n\n**III. Specific Findings and Results:**\n\n*   Adversarial patch attacks can reduce model confidence by over 20%.\n*   Inpainting-based defense can effectively counter these attacks, restoring confidence levels.\n*   The specific success rate of the inpainting defense is quantified by the \"ratio\" metric described above, although specific values aren't consistently presented across all experiments.\n\n**IV. Limitations and Future Work (Indicating Potential Trends):**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges the need for expanding datasets, exploring various attack strategies, and transitioning patches from simulation to real-world tests.\n*   Future work includes exploring automated patch mask position generation and adaptive defense mechanisms.  This indicates a trend towards more sophisticated and automated defense strategies.\n\n**V. References to Recent Work:**\n\n*   The paper references several articles published between 2011 and 2023, although only one ([10]) is a survey focusing specifically on physical adversarial attacks in computer vision, suggesting the relative novelty of this area.\n*  The article by Chen, Junwen, and Xingxing Wei, \"Defending Adversarial Patches via Joint Region Localizing and Inpainting,\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.14242, 2023, showcases inpainting as means for dealing with adversarial attacks, indicating this is a current area of research.\n\n**Summary of Trends:**\n\nBased on this paper, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification include:\n\n*   **Focus on Physical Attacks:** Moving beyond purely digital attacks to address real-world vulnerabilities.\n*   **Spatial Awareness:** Recognizing the importance of spatial information (patch location) in both attacks and defenses.\n*   **Inpainting-Based Defenses:** Utilizing inpainting techniques to repair images corrupted by adversarial patches.\n*   **Adaptive and Automated Defenses:**  Moving towards more sophisticated defense mechanisms that can automatically detect and mitigate attacks.\n*   **Evaluation Beyond Accuracy:**  Using more nuanced metrics (like the \"ratio\" defined in the paper) to assess the effectiveness of defenses.\n*   **Activation Functions:** Taking into consideration the effect of activation functions on the vulnerability of the AI model.\n\nThis detailed breakdown should give you a comprehensive overview of the relevant information from the paper in relation to your research question."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the paper's content, focusing on potential trends and recent research:\n\n**I. General Overview of the Paper**\n\n*   **Focus:** The paper primarily investigates the *impact* of two specific adversarial attacks (FGSM and adversarial patch attacks) on the performance of pre-trained CNN image classifiers (ResNet-34, GoogleNet, DenseNet-161). It analyzes classification accuracy with and without these attacks on the ImageNet dataset.\n\n*   **Adversarial Attacks Discussed:**\n    *   **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM):** Aims to maximize the loss function by perturbing the input image pixels slightly in the direction of the gradient.\n    *   **Adversarial Patch Attack:**  Involves inserting a patch (a small image) into the original image to cause misclassification.\n\n*   **CNN Architectures Tested:** ResNet-34, GoogleNet, DenseNet-161.\n\n**II.  Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness)**\n\nWhile this paper *demonstrates* the vulnerability of image classification models to adversarial attacks, it does *not* focus heavily on presenting the *latest defense mechanisms* or *trends* in adversarial robustness, but it references some papers that could provide some clues. The work primarily focuses on highlighting the *problem* rather than providing state-of-the-art *solutions*.\n\nHere's what *can* be gleaned regarding trends, primarily from the \"Related Work\" section and the conclusion:\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training as a Defense:**\n\n    *   The paper mentions that *\"Training on adversarial examples can lead to a better regularization of the classification models.\"* This alludes to adversarial training being a relevant defense strategy.\n\n    *   It further notes (citing [21]) that *\"adversarial training is one of the most effective defense strategies because it can generalize across different threat models.\"*\n\n    *   Tramer et al. [18] proposed ensemble adversarial training, a method that adds perturbations obtained from other models to training data.\n\n    *   **Inference:** Adversarial training appears to be a prominent trend, with variations like ensemble adversarial training being explored.\n\n2.  **Benchmark Development:**\n\n    *   Dong et al. [21] *\"developed a reliable benchmark for assessing adversarial resilience on image classification tasks.\"* The paper also highlights the use of model robustness curves as an evaluation tool.\n\n    *   **Inference:** Standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics (like robustness curves) are important for comparing different defense strategies.\n\n3.  **Defense Strategy Categorization:**\n\n    *   Chen et al. [22] examine and evaluate defense strategies from four perspectives:\n        *   Gradient masking\n        *   Adversarial training\n        *   Adversarial example detection\n        *   Input modifications\n\n    *   **Inference:**  This suggests that research is being conducted on different aspects of defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks like gradient masking, adversarial training, adversarial example detection, and input modifications\n\n4.  **Randomization-based defenses**\n\n    *   Dong et al. [21] mention that *\"randomization-based defenses are more resistant to query-based black-box attacks.\"*\n\n5.  **Novel methods to create adversarial samples**\n    *   Papernot et al. [14] proposed a novel method to create adversarial samples based on a thorough comprehension of the mapping between inputs and outputs of deep neural networks\n\n**III. Limitations in Answering the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Publication Date:** The paper doesn't explicitly state the publication date within the provided Markdown text. This makes it impossible to strictly enforce the \"last 2 years\" criterion without external information. However, since the latest accessed date in the references is May 9, 2023, this is likely to be around 2023, but it's not confirmed.\n\n*   **Depth of Discussion on Robustness:** The paper focuses more on demonstrating *vulnerability* to attacks than on in-depth analysis of the latest robustness techniques.\n\n*   **Scope of References:** While the paper cites some works related to adversarial robustness, it doesn't provide a comprehensive survey of the most recent advances in the field.\n\n**IV.

      "relevancy": "This paper focuses on developing a robust perceptual similarity metric (LipSim) that is resilient to adversarial attacks. Given that perceptual similarity metrics are often used in image classification tasks, improving their adversarial robustness is relevant.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this research paper to answer the question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**I. Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper focuses on *adversarial robustness of perceptual similarity metrics*, specifically in the context of image comparison.  It identifies vulnerabilities in existing metrics like DreamSim and proposes a new metric, LipSim, that offers provable robustness guarantees. This is not directly *image classification* but on *image similarity*. However, the techniques used are relevant to the general field of adversarial robustness.\n\n**II. Relevance to the Research Question (Adversarial Robustness Trends):**\n\nThe paper touches on several trends in adversarial robustness, particularly those related to *certified robustness* and *Lipschitz-constrained networks*.  Here's a breakdown of the relevant points, extracted with a focus on trends within the last 2 years:\n\n*   **Vulnerability of Perceptual Similarity Metrics:** The paper highlights a growing awareness that perceptual similarity metrics (which are often based on neural networks) are susceptible to adversarial attacks.  This is a trend; as these metrics become more widely used (e.g., for image retrieval, copy detection), their vulnerability becomes a greater concern. The paper mentions the following papers about this:\n    *   (Ghildyal & Liu, 2022): This paper employs modules including anti-aliasing filters to provide robustness to the vulnerability of LPIPS to a one-pixel shift.\n    *   (Luo et al., 2022): proposes a new way to generate attacks to similarity metrics by reducing the similarity between the adversarial example and its original while increasing the similarity between the adversarial example and its most dissimilar one in the minibatch.\n    *   (Sj\u00a8ogren et al., 2022): This paper presents a qualitative analysis of deep perceptual similarity metrics resilience to image distortions including color inversion, translation, rotation, and color stain.\n\n*   **Certified Robustness:** The paper emphasizes the move towards *certified* adversarial robustness, which provides mathematical guarantees that a model is robust against attacks within a specific perturbation budget.  This contrasts with empirical defenses, which might work well in practice but don't offer formal guarantees.\n    *   It highlights the limitations of *randomized smoothing* (Cohen et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2019) in terms of computational cost and probabilistic guarantees, especially for real-time applications.\n    *   The paper highlights that recent research focuses on designing and training neural networks with prescribed Lipschitz constants (Tsuzuku et al., 2018; Meunier et al., 2022; Wang & Manchester, 2023), aiming to improve and guarantee robustness against adversarial attacks. Promising techniques, like the SDP-based Lipschitz Layer (SLL) (Araujo et al., 2023), have emerged and allow to design of non-trivial yet efficient neural networks with pre-defined Lipschitz constant.\n\n*   **Lipschitz Continuity:** A key trend is leveraging the *Lipschitz property* of neural networks to improve robustness.\n    *   Constraining the Lipschitz constant of a neural network is linked to stability in training (Miyato et al., 2018), robustness (Tsuzuku et al., 2018), and generalization (Bartlett et al., 2017).\n    *   The paper cites various approaches for designing 1-Lipschitz networks, including spectral normalization (Miyato et al., 2018; Farnia et al., 2018), orthogonal weight matrices (Li et al., 2019; Prach & Lampert, 2022), and dynamical systems/control theory arguments (Meunier et al., 2022; Araujo et al., 2023; Wang & Manchester, 2023).\n    *   SDP-based Lipschitz Layer (SLL) (Araujo et al., 2023) is an example of a recent technique to design efficient Lipschitz-constrained networks.\n\n*   **Attacks:** The paper uses APGD (Croce & Hein, 2020) for attacking the metrics.\n\n**III. LipSim: A Concrete Example of Recent Trends**\n\nThe LipSim metric itself embodies several of these trends:\n\n*   It's based on a *1-Lipschitz neural network* architecture.\n*   It provides *certified robustness* guarantees (Theorem 1).\n*   It's designed to be more robust than existing perceptual similarity metrics against adversarial attacks, addressing a specific vulnerability.\n*   It's trained using a student-teacher approach (DreamSim as teacher, Lipschitz network as student), a common technique for distilling knowledge and improving efficiency.\n\n**IV. Specific Papers Mentioned (Last 2 Years):**\n\nHere's a list of the papers cited in the document which are relevant to adversarial robustness and were published in the last 2 years (2022-2024), along with their main contribution, as described in the analyzed paper:\n\n*   **Araujo et al., 2023:** Proposed SDP-based Lipschitz Layers (SLL), allowing for the design of efficient neural networks with pre-defined Lipschitz constants.\n*   **Cherti et al., 2023:**  Authors of Open CLIP (used within the DreamSim metric). The paper cites this work because DreamSim uses Open CLIP.\n*   **Fu et al., 2023:** Authors of DreamSim, a state-of-the-art perceptual similarity metric. The analyzed paper investigates its vulnerabilities.\n*   **Ghazanfari et al., 2023:**  Authors of R-LPIPS, an adversarially robust perceptual similarity metric achieved by adversarial training over LPIPS. The analyzed paper compares against it.\n*   **Ghildyal & Liu, 2022:** Authors that employed modules including anti-aliasing filters to provide robustness to the vulnerability of LPIPS to a one-pixel shift.\n*   **Luo et al., 2022:** Authors of a new way to generate attacks to similarity metrics by reducing the similarity between the adversarial example and its original while increasing the similarity between the adversarial example and its most dissimilar one in the minibatch.\n*   **Meunier et al., 2022:** Designing 1-Lipschitz layer from dynamical systems\n*   **Prach & Lampert, 2022:** Replacing the normalized weight matrix by an orthogonal one.\n*   **Shao et al., 2023:** propose methods to achieve certified robustness on perceptual metrics based on randomized smoothing.\n*   **Wang & Manchester, 2023:** Designing 1-Lipschitz layer from control theory arguments\n*   **Sj\u00a8ogren et al., 2022:** presents a qualitative analysis of deep perceptual similarity metrics resilience to image distortions including color inversion, translation, rotation, and color stain.\n\n**V. Limitations & Caveats:**\n\n*   The paper's primary focus is *perceptual similarity*, not direct image classification. While the techniques are relevant, the application is different.\n*   The paper does not provide a broad survey of *all* adversarial robustness techniques. It is focused on the specific sub-area of robust perceptual metrics.\n\n**In summary, the latest trends in adversarial robustness, as reflected in this paper, include a focus on certified robustness, leveraging Lipschitz continuity to design more robust networks, and addressing the vulnerabilities of neural-network-based perceptual similarity metrics.**"

      "relevancy": "While primarily focused on watermarking AI-generated images, this paper incorporates state-of-the-art smoothing techniques to provide provable guarantees against adversarial attacks targeting watermark removal. This relates to adversarial robustness, though in a slightly different context.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title & Focus:**\n\n*   The paper, titled \"RAW: A Robust and Agile Plug-and-Play Watermark Framework for AI-Generated Images with Provable Guarantees,\" primarily focuses on watermarking AI-generated images, specifically diffusion model outputs. While not directly about general image classification robustness, it addresses the adversarial robustness of *watermarks* against removal attempts, which is a relevant sub-area.\n*   The core trend that this paper addresses is the development of robust watermarking techniques that can withstand adversarial attacks designed to remove or disrupt the watermark.\n\n**Key Contributions Related to Adversarial Robustness (within the context of watermarking):**\n\n1.  **Learnable Watermarks in Frequency and Spatial Domains:**\n\n    *   The paper proposes embedding *learnable* watermarks into both the frequency and spatial domains of the original images. This contrasts with earlier methods that use fixed binary codes in latent spaces.\n    *   The idea is that combining frequency and spatial domain watermarks leverages the strengths of each: frequency domain watermarks are generally more resistant to manipulations like translation and resizing, while spatial domain watermarks can be more robust to noise.\n    *   *Relevance to robustness*: This multi-domain approach aims to increase resilience to a broader range of attacks, as attackers would need to target both domains effectively to remove the watermark.\n2.  **Joint Training of Watermark and Classifier:**\n\n    *   A classifier (e.g., a CNN) is jointly trained with the watermarks to distinguish between watermarked and unwatermarked images.\n    *   *Relevance to robustness*: Joint training likely leads to a more co-adapted watermark and detector, making it harder for an adversary to remove the watermark without significantly degrading image quality (which would make the attack less stealthy). The classifier learns what to look for in a watermark, and the watermark learns how to be more easily detectable yet robust to modifications.\n3.  **Integration of Data Augmentation and Adversarial Training:**\n\n    *   The framework incorporates data augmentation during training to improve robustness. The loss function includes cross-entropy on original and augmented datasets.\n    *   Mention is made of the potential to further enhance robustness using adversarial training, contrastive learning, and label smoothing. Although these are mentioned as future possibilities the authors seem aware of the benefits of adversarial training for the overall adversarial robustness of the system.\n    *   *Relevance to robustness:* Data augmentation exposes the watermark detector to a wider variety of image transformations during training, making it more resilient to those transformations at inference time.\n4.  **Provable Guarantees on False Positive Rate (FPR) under Adversarial Attacks:**\n\n    *   The paper integrates techniques from conformal prediction and randomized smoothing to provide provable guarantees on the FPR, even under \"moderate\" adversarial attacks.\n    *   A \"robust\" version of the classifier is created using randomized smoothing, such that small perturbations to the input image do not drastically change the classifier's output.\n    *   *Relevance to robustness:* This is a key aspect of the paper's contribution. By providing certified guarantees, the authors are going beyond empirical evaluations and offering a theoretical bound on the watermark's vulnerability. The randomized smoothing provides a Lipschitz constant on the classifier, meaning that if adversarial attacks stay within a predefined norm range, the FPR guarantees remain valid.\n5.  **Evaluation Against State-of-the-Art Watermark Removal Attacks:**\n\n    *   The paper evaluates the framework against several state-of-the-art watermark removal techniques, including VAE-based attacks and diffusion model-based attacks.\n    *   The experiments showed substantial performance enhancements, demonstrated by notable increases in AUROC. The RAW framework demonstrated an increase in AUROC from 0.48 to 0.82 compared to existing methods when detecting watermarked images under adversarial attacks.\n    *   *Relevance to robustness*: These experiments provide empirical evidence of the framework's robustness against specific attack strategies.\n\n**Related Work Mentions:**\n\n*   The \"Related Work\" section discusses existing watermarking techniques, including classical spatial and frequency domain methods, and more recent deep learning-based approaches using encoder-decoder architectures. It points out the vulnerabilities of traditional methods to adversarial attacks and the computational overhead of some deep learning methods.\n*   The related works mention the idea of embedding watermarks into the model weights.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on the robustness of the *watermark*, not necessarily the robustness of a general image classifier. However, the techniques used to defend against watermark removal attacks (e.g., adversarial training, randomized smoothing) are relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness in image classification.\n*   The \"Threat Model\" assumes a specific scenario involving an artist, a generative model provider, and an adversary. The adversarial attacks considered are primarily those aimed at removing the watermark, not at misclassifying the image itself.\n*   The theoretical guarantees on FPR hold only for \"moderate\" adversarial attacks (i.e., those that stay within a predefined \u21132-norm bound).\n\n**Trends Identified:**\n\nBased on this paper, the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (specifically, within the context of watermarking) can be identified:\n\n1.  **Moving Beyond Fixed Watermarks:** Shifting from fixed, easily detectable watermarks to *learnable* watermarks that are more adaptive to the data and the detection mechanism.\n2.  **Combining Multiple Domains:** Leveraging the strengths of both frequency and spatial domain watermarking to increase resilience to diverse attacks.\n3.  **Joint Training and Co-adaptation:** Jointly training the watermark and the detector to create a more robust and interconnected system.\n4.  **Formal Robustness Guarantees:** Developing methods that provide provable (or certified) robustness guarantees, rather than relying solely on empirical evaluations. Techniques like randomized smoothing are used to achieve this.\n5.  **Focus on Practical Deployability:** Balancing robustness with computational efficiency for real-time, on-the-fly deployment.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe paper contributes to the trend of creating more robust and secure watermarking techniques for AI-generated content. It does this by using learnable watermarks, training classifiers to detect them, integrating adversarial training principles, and trying to guarantee the integrity of watermarks even if adversaries try to remove them. The ultimate goal is to protect the intellectual property rights to the generated content. While not the primary focus, this paper is extremely relevant to those researching image classification adversarial robustness, and presents some interesting defense mechanisms that researchers may want to consider to defend against adversarial attacks."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed breakdown of the provided paper concerning the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**High-Level Summary of the Paper's Relevance**\n\nThe paper \"CrossCert: A Cross-Checking Detection Approach to Patch Robustness Certification for Deep Learning Models\" is highly relevant to the research question. It directly addresses adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically focusing on robustness against *patch attacks*. The techniques discussed fall within the scope of certified defenses, which provide provable guarantees of robustness.\n\n**Key Information from the Paper (organized by relevance to the research question):**\n\n1.  **Focus Area:**\n    *   **Patch Robustness:** The paper primarily investigates defenses against *patch adversarial attacks*. These attacks involve modifying a localized region (patch) of an image to cause misclassification. This is a relevant and active area within adversarial robustness.\n\n2.  **Type of Defense:**\n    *   **Certified Defense:**  The paper contributes to the area of *certified defenses*. This is a crucial distinction. Certified defenses don't just *try* to be robust; they provide mathematical *guarantees* about their robustness within specified threat models (e.g., a bound on the size and location of the adversarial patch).\n\n3.  **Specific Techniques and Trends:**\n    *   **Certified Recovery vs. Certified Detection:** The paper identifies two main lines of research within certified patch robustness:\n        *   **Certified Recovery:** Aims to *correct* the classification of a maliciously perturbed image, assigning it the correct (benign) label with a guarantee.  Examples include voting-based recovery [3, 20, 22, 23, 28, 31, 35, 42, 44] as well as masking-based recovery [36].\n        *   **Certified Detection:** Aims to *detect* the presence of an adversarial attack and issue a warning, rather than trying to correct the classification. Examples include masking-based detection [10, 15, 22, 27, 37].\n    *   **CrossCert (The Paper's Contribution):** The paper's central contribution is a new certified defense technique called *CrossCert*. It's a *certified detection* method. The novelty lies in its use of a *cross-checking framework* that combines *two certified recovery* defenders.  This allows for:\n        *   **Unwavering Certification:** CrossCert introduces the concept of \"unwavering certification,\" which guarantees that a certified sample, even when attacked with a patch, will always be returned with a benign label *without triggering any warnings*. This is a stronger guarantee than typical certified detection.\n    * Voting-Based Recovery\n    * Masking-Based Detection and Recovery\n\n4.  **Architectures:**\n    *   **Vision Transformers (ViT):** This emerges as a prominent architecture in the field of certified robustness, particularly for patch attacks. The paper mentions using Vision Transformer (ViT-b16-224) and ResNet-50 as base models. It observes, consistent with other studies, that ViT-based defenses tend to achieve higher certified accuracy.\n    *   **ResNet:** A convolutional neural network architecture used as a comparison.\n\n5.  **Related Work:**\n    * The related work section provides a good overview of the recent research landscape.\n    * Recent voting-based techniques (DRS [20], ViT [31], ViP [22], and ECViT [3]).\n    * PatchGuard [35], MC [44], and BagCert [28].\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Single-Patch Attacks:** The experiments are limited to single-patch attacks. Real-world scenarios might involve more complex attack patterns.\n*   **Limited Datasets and Patch Sizes:** The evaluation is conducted on three datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR10, CIFAR100) and with limited patch sizes.\n*   **No Real Adversarial Attacks:** The paper does not evaluate CrossCert on real-world adversarial attacks.\n*   **Computational Cost:** It is also important to consider the relatively large time to certify each sample, which is about 9 hours for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and 41 hours for ImageNet.\n\n**Overall Trends and Insights from the Paper:**\n\n*   **Emphasis on Certified Robustness:** The trend is clearly toward developing defenses with provable guarantees of robustness.\n*   **Patch Attacks as a Key Challenge:**  Adversarial patches are a significant concern, motivating research into specialized defense techniques.\n*   **Vision Transformers (ViTs) are promising:** The architecture of choice for many state-of-the-art certified defenses.\n*   **Combining Recovery and Detection:** CrossCert represents a trend in combining certified recovery and certified detection techniques to provide more comprehensive protection.\n*   **Beyond Simple Detection:** The introduction of \"unwavering certification\" suggests a move toward more nuanced and practical robustness guarantees. This acknowledges the need to not only detect attacks but also ensure the reliability of benign classifications even under attack.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   The reference list is extremely valuable for further exploration of the latest research in this area.  Pay close attention to the papers published in top-tier computer vision and machine learning conferences (e.g., CVPR, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR).\n*   The \"Data Availability\" section points to a GitHub repository. Examining the code and implementation details can provide deeper insights into the practical aspects of the techniques.\n\nIn summary, this paper presents a relevant contribution to the field, highlighting the increasing importance of certified robustness, the challenges posed by patch attacks, and the promise of Vision Transformers and combined defense strategies. It also suggests a trend toward stronger, more practical robustness guarantees."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the information from the provided paper that directly addresses the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\", focusing on details published within the last two years.\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper & Relevance to Adversarial Robustness**\n\n*   **The paper directly addresses adversarial robustness**, albeit in the context of common image corruptions rather than explicitly adversarial attacks. The authors highlight that models like CLIP lack robustness to common image corruptions, which is a *distributional shift* that can be seen as a form of adversarial challenge, especially in safety-critical applications.\n\n**II. Key Trends and Methods Explored (Last 2 Years)**\n\n*   **Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) is a central trend:** The paper positions itself within the TTA research area, specifically focusing on adapting pre-trained models like CLIP to unlabeled, corrupted images *during testing*. TTA methods are used to maintain accurate predictions when test data distributions differ from training distributions, and are becoming increasingly popular for boosting robustness. The paper emphasizes that TTA is essential for handling distributional shifts, which are common in real-world scenarios.\n\n*   **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) and VLMs (Vision-Language Models) are important architectures:** The trend is to leverage powerful pre-trained models like CLIP for various vision tasks, while also recognizing their limitations in robustness. The work investigates how to make these models *more reliable* when facing corrupted or \"adversarial\" images. This is a key trend in using large models safely.\n\n*   **Limitations of Existing TTA Methods for CLIP:** The paper points out that earlier TTA methods (prior to their work) have *limitations in adapting CLIP* effectively, often due to their *unimodal nature*. These methods typically focus on adapting either the visual or textual encoder of CLIP, but not both jointly.\n\n*   **Bimodal Adaptation is the proposed solution:** The main trend proposed is a \"bimodal\" approach to TTA. This involves jointly adapting both the visual and text encoders of CLIP during test time to improve robustness. The specific technique proposed (BAT-CLIP) focuses on enhancing the *alignment* between image and text features within the shared feature space of CLIP. The authors argue that joint optimization of both encoders leads to stronger multimodal alignment and better performance.\n\n*   **Specific Methods and Techniques in BAT-CLIP (Important for understanding the trend):**\n    *   **Adapting LayerNorm Parameters:** The paper adapts the LayerNorm parameters of both visual and text encoders during TTA. This is noted as being parameter-efficient compared to fine-tuning the entire model.\n    *   **Projection Matching Loss (Lpm):** A loss function that encourages alignment between visual class prototypes and their corresponding text features. This maximizes the projection of the visual feature onto the text feature.\n    *   **Inter-Class Separability Loss (Lsp):** A loss function that increases the cosine distance between class prototypes, encouraging the learning of more discriminative visual features and improving class separation.\n\n*   **Benchmarking against existing CLIP TTA Methods:** The authors benchmarked against existing CLIP-based TTA methods, specifically Test-Time Prompt Tuning (TPT) and Vision-Text-Space Ensemble (VTE).  This positions their contribution relative to the current state-of-the-art in this area. They emphasize the unimodal nature of TPT and the computational expense of both TPT and VTE.\n\n*   **Emphasis on Practicality & Real-Time Deployment:**  The paper emphasizes the importance of *real-time deployment* and avoiding methods that rely on extensive prompt engineering or multiple forward passes.\n\n**III. Experiments and Results (Illustrating the Trends)**\n\n*   **Datasets Used:** CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C are used as benchmark datasets for evaluating robustness to common image corruptions.\n*   **Baselines and Comparisons:** Comparisons are made against zero-shot CLIP, TPT, VTE, and other TTA methods adopted for CLIP, including TENT, RoTTA, RPL, and SAR.\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   CLIP's zero-shot performance drops significantly under image corruptions.\n    *   BAT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance for CLIP adaptation to common corruptions.\n    *   Bimodal adaptation (jointly adapting visual and text encoders) is more effective than unimodal approaches.\n\n**IV.

      "relevancy": "The paper is about robustifying language models with test-time adaptation, focusing on adversarial language examples. While it addresses robustness, it's outside the scope of *image* classification, so I am not including it.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to the research question, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years:\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on *adversarial robustness in **language models***, specifically text classification. It does **not** directly address image classification. The paper proposes a *test-time adaptation* method called \"Mask-Defense\" to robustify language models against adversarial text attacks.\n\n**Why the Paper is Not Directly Relevant (But Contains Some General Insights):**\n\n*   **Domain Mismatch:** The research question specifically asks about *image* classification, whereas this paper deals with *text* classification.\n*   **Core Technique:** The proposed defense mechanism, Mask-Defense, leverages masked language modeling, a technique specific to natural language processing. This technique isn't directly transferable to image classification without significant modification and conceptual re-framing.\n\n**Indirectly Relevant Information and Potential General Trends (To Extrapolate from NLP to Images):**\n\nEven though the paper doesn't focus on image classification, some aspects of the approach and related work cited might hint at more general trends applicable across domains:\n\n1.  **Shift from Training-Time to Test-Time Defenses:** The paper explicitly frames its contribution as a shift in focus from making models robust during *training* to making them robust during *testing* (inference).\n    *   **Details:**  The authors argue that retraining for robustness is unrealistic for large foundation models because of the vast number of possible attacks, the inability to adapt to novel attacks, and the lack of generalization to new tasks.\n    *   **Implication (for image classification):**  This suggests a trend towards developing methods that can adapt to adversarial attacks *on the fly* without requiring extensive retraining. This might involve techniques like dynamically adjusting the model or input based on detected anomalies or adversarial patterns.\n\n2.  **Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning for Robustness:** The core of the Mask-Defense approach is using a masked language model to identify and correct adversarial modifications.\n    *   **Details:** The paper uses the masked language modeling loss as a measure of word importance.\n    *   **Implication (for image classification):** This indicates a trend of using self-supervised learning objectives (e.g., contrastive learning, autoencoders) to build models that are more sensitive to the underlying structure of the data and can therefore better detect and resist adversarial perturbations.\n\n3.  **\"Reverse Attack\" Concept:**  The paper introduces the idea of a \"reverse attack,\" where the defense attempts to undo the adversarial modification.\n    *   **Details:** In language, this involves identifying and replacing adversarial words with more appropriate words based on contextual understanding.\n    *   **Implication (for image classification):**  The analogous concept in image classification would be to try and \"repair\" the adversarial image by identifying and removing the adversarial noise or distortions, effectively restoring the image to a more \"natural\" state.

(2022) are mentioned in the paper as examples of applying this technique to image classification and segmentation, and video perception, even though they require multiple steps of test-time optimization.\n\n4.  **Limitations of Test-Time Defenses:**  The paper acknowledges that Mask-Defense is not perfect and can fail for severely perturbed examples.\n    *   **Details:** The analysis in Table 3 suggests that the defense works best when the adversarial attack pushes the example just over the decision boundary.\n    *   **Implication (for image classification):**  This highlights the importance of understanding the *severity* of the attack and potentially adapting the defense strategy accordingly.\n\n5.  **Citations of Relevant Papers (Indirectly Related to Image Classification):** The paper mentions the following papers related to reverse attacks using self-supervised learning, which are related to images:\n    *   Mao et al.

(2023)\n\n**Key Takeaways (and Caveats):**\n\n*   While this paper is about adversarial robustness in *language*, it suggests a *potential* trend of moving towards test-time adaptation and leveraging self-supervised learning for robustness.\n*   The specific techniques used in the paper (masked language modeling) are not directly applicable to image classification.\n*   The \"reverse attack\" concept and the understanding of the limitations of test-time defenses are potentially valuable insights that could inform research in image classification robustness.\n*   The listed citations might point to more directly relevant papers on image classification robustness that utilize similar \"reverse attack\" or self-supervised learning approaches.  You should investigate these citations.\n\nIn summary, this paper is *not* directly relevant to your research question, but it provides some broader context and potentially useful insights that could be extrapolated to the image classification domain. The citations are the most valuable part in terms of finding relevant research."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to your research question, focusing on adversarial robustness for image classification in the last two years (2022-2024):\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on *Single Image Test-Time Adaptation (SITTA)* for *semantic segmentation*, NOT image classification. However, it does explore methods that *could* be related to adversarial robustness indirectly and mentions some relevant works in the related work section and in the used methodologies. The core idea is to adapt a pre-trained segmentation model to a new, unseen target domain using only the test image itself, without access to the original training data or other target domain samples.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness (and limitations):**\n\nWhile the paper's main contribution is in test-time adaptation for segmentation, some aspects touch upon concepts relevant to adversarial robustness in classification, particularly the \"Adversarial-Attack (Adv)\" method and the use of augmentations.\n\n**Specific Mentions/Experiments Related to Adversarial Attacks:**\n\n*   **Adversarial-Attack (Adv):** The paper mentions an \"Adversarial-Attack (Adv)\" method proposed by Nguyen et al. (b) for *image classification*. This is adapted for the segmentation task. The optimization loss is computed as the reverse KL divergence loss between the model prediction s\u2032 = fS[\u03b8](x\u2032) where x\u2032 is an adversarially transformed image and the prediction on the original input s = fS[\u03b8](x).\n*   **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM):** The paper mentions reducing the computational complexity of generating adversarial examples by using the Fast Gradient Sign Method.\n*   **Augmentation-Consistency (AugCo):** The paper also uses augmentations which can be seen as a way to improve robustness.\n\n**TTA Methods and their Relevance to Robustness (Indirect):**\n\nThe paper evaluates several TTA methods, some of which could be linked to improving robustness against certain types of distribution shifts or input perturbations:\n\n*   **Entropy Minimization (Ent):** Aims to minimize the entropy of the segmentation model's predictions, which can sometimes lead to more stable and robust predictions.\n*   **Pseudo-Labelling (PL):**  Uses the model's own predictions as pseudo-labels to fine-tune the model on the test image. This *could* improve robustness if the pseudo-labels are reasonably accurate, but could also backfire if they are noisy.\n*   **Augmentation-Consistency (AugCo):** Enforces consistency between predictions on different augmented versions of the input image. This is directly related to improving robustness, as it encourages the model to be invariant to certain transformations.\n*   **Mask Refinement (Ref) & Deep-Intersection-over-Union (dIoU):** These methods aim to refine the segmentation mask, which *could* make the model less sensitive to small input perturbations that might change the mask.\n\n**Experimental Setup and Datasets:**\n\n*   The paper uses the GTA5 dataset (synthetic) and Cityscapes/ACDC (real-world) datasets for evaluation.\n*   It introduces a SITTA training set derived from 40 images for hyperparameter tuning.\n*   It corrupts the GTA5 dataset to create GTA5-C, and COCO to create COCO-C using various corruptions like brightness, contrast, frost, fog, gaussian noise, shot noise, spatter, defocus blur, gaussian blur, and JPEG compression.  These corruptions simulate real-world distribution shifts and can be seen as a form of testing robustness.\n\n**Key Results (relating to robustness, albeit indirectly):**\n\n*   The experiments show that TTA methods can improve performance on corrupted datasets (GTA5-C, COCO-C), indicating a degree of robustness to distribution shifts.\n*   Augmentation-Consistency (AugCo) and Mask Refinement (Ref) methods often perform well, suggesting that enforcing consistency and refining predictions can be beneficial for robustness.\n*   The paper analyzes the relationship between the initial prediction quality (mIoUi) and the improvement gained from TTA. It finds that TTA is often more effective for images with initially low mIoUi.\n*   The paper also analyzes the relationship between prediction entropy and mIoUi improvement, finding similar trends.\n\n**Relevant Citations (within the last 2 years - 2022-2024):**\n\nThese citations may contain information about recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, although they are used in the context of segmentation in this paper:\n\n*   Iwasaki, Y., Sumiyoshi, F., Uesato, J., & Asama, H.

Therefore, the methods and experiments are tailored for segmentation tasks.\n*   **Indirect Relevance:** The connection to adversarial robustness is indirect. The paper doesn't explicitly evaluate the methods against adversarial attacks designed to fool the classifier. It's more about robustness to general distribution shifts and corruptions.\n*   **Limited Scope on Adversarial Training:** The \"Adversarial-Attack\" method is mentioned, but the paper doesn't delve deeply into different adversarial training techniques or defenses.\n\n**In conclusion:**  While this paper doesn't directly address the latest trends in *adversarial robustness for image classification*, it offers insights into test-time adaptation techniques that can improve model robustness to distribution shifts, and it references some relevant works that might be useful for your research. The \"Adversarial-Attack\" method and the use of augmentations are the most relevant aspects. You would need to consult the cited papers (especially those from 2022-2024) for more specific information on adversarial robustness in image classification."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of information from the provided paper that addresses the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on **test-time adaptation (TTA)** for **vision-language models (VLMs)**, specifically CLIP and its variants. It explores strategies to adapt these models to distribution shifts encountered during inference.\n*   The authors investigate both **prompt-based approaches** (modifying input prompts) and applying **existing TTA methods from image classification** to VLMs.\n*   The goal is to improve the **robustness** and **adaptability** of VLMs in real-world settings where data distributions may differ from the training data.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness and Recent Trends (Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe paper **indirectly** relates to adversarial robustness for image classification through the lens of test-time adaptation.  While it doesn't explicitly focus *solely* on adversarial attacks, it does investigate robustness against various distribution shifts, some of which can be considered related to adversarial examples or corruptions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant aspects:\n\n1.  **Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) as a Defense:** TTA can be viewed as a form of defense against distribution shifts, including those caused by adversarial attacks. The idea is to adapt the model to the specific test-time conditions, making it more resilient to unforeseen or manipulated inputs.\n\n2.  **Specific TTA Methods Discussed (and their relevance to robustness):**\n\n    *   **TENT (Test-Time Entropy Minimization):**  Minimizes the entropy of the model's predictions on the test data. This aims to make the model more confident in its predictions, which *can* improve robustness.\n    *   **EATA (Elastic Average Test-Time Adaptation):**  Introduces a loss weighting and filtering scheme that accounts for the reliability and diversity of a sample to prevent catastrophic forgetting on the initial training domain.\n    *   **SAR (Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Reliability):** Proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method to handle large and noisy gradients that can promote trivial solutions\n    *   **DeYO** Incorporates a confidence metric that measures the extent to which the probability of pseudo-label decreases after applying an image transformation that distorts the shape of the objects.\n    *   **CMF (Continual Momentum Filtering):**  Utilizes a Kalman filter to derive a model that is both resilient to catastrophic forgetting and highly adaptable.  Catastrophic forgetting is a concern when adapting models to new distributions, as they might \"forget\" what they learned initially.\n    *   **ROID:** Puts emphasis on using certainty and diversity weighting to prevent the occurrence of trivial solutions during the adaptation.\n\n    *It's important to note that the paper itself references papers published within the last 2 years regarding these TTA methods (see the reference list and mentions within the text, such as ROID [29], DeYO [24], ICASSP [3] etc.)*. Therefore, these methods *do* represent recent trends.\n\n3.  **Datasets Used for Evaluation:**\n    * ImageNet-A: This dataset *explicitly* contains adversarial examples. Evaluating on ImageNet-A directly assesses the model's robustness against adversarial attacks.\n    * ImageNet-C: Includes common image corruptions. While not strictly adversarial, these corruptions represent a type of distribution shift that can degrade model performance, similar to adversarial examples.\n    * ImageNet-R, ImageNet-Sketch, ImageNet-D109, ImageNet-V2: These datasets represent natural distribution shifts, which are related to the broader concept of robustness.\n\n4.  **Key Findings Related to Robustness:**\n\n    *   The paper shows that applying existing TTA methods from image classification to VLMs *can* improve their robustness against distribution shifts.\n    *   Methods like **ROID** and **CMF** showed the most promising results, indicating that techniques designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting and ensure stable adaptation are crucial for VLMs.\n    *   The improvement from TTA varies depending on the type of distribution shift. For example, ROID and CMF showed significant improvements on ImageNet-C and EuroSAT.\n    *   The benefit of TTA diminishes as the size and initial performance of the model increase, but even for large models (ViT-H-14), TTA can still provide some gains.\n    *   Updating *only* the vision encoder is generally more effective than also updating the text encoder, due to the computational overhead and lack of significant performance improvement.\n\n**Specific Evidence of Recent Trends (within the last 2 years, based on citations):**\n\n*   The paper cites several works published in recent years related to TTA, including:\n    *   **ROID [29]**\n    *   **CMF [23]**\n    *   **SAR [34]**\n    *   **DeYO [24]**\n    *   **ICASSP [3]**\n    *   **The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations [14]**\n    *   **The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations [24]**\n    *   **The Tenth International Conference on Learning Representations [42]**\n\n    These citations indicate that the paper is building upon and evaluating recent advancements in TTA techniques.\n\n**Summary of Trends Relevant to Adversarial Robustness (Indirectly):**\n\nBased on the paper, and focusing on the last 2 years, here are the relevant trends regarding robustness, albeit indirectly:\n\n1.  **Application of TTA to Vision-Language Models:** A growing trend is to adapt techniques developed for image classification to the more complex domain of vision-language models, to improve the robustness of VLMs.\n\n2.  **Importance of Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting:** TTA methods like CMF and ROID, which focus on preventing catastrophic forgetting, are showing promise for maintaining robustness across different distribution shifts.\n\n3.  **Emphasis on Certainty and Diversity:** ROID's emphasis on certainty and diversity weighting suggests that these factors are important for successful test-time adaptation.\n\n4.  **Adaptive Learning Rates and Sharpness-Aware Minimization:** The use of techniques like sharpness-aware minimization (as in SAR) indicates a trend towards more sophisticated optimization strategies during test-time adaptation.\n\n5.  **Confidence metrics:** Techniques like DeYO which leverage confidence metrics can improve overall robustness during test-time adaptation.\n\n**Limitations of the Paper in Answering the Research Question:**\n\n*   The paper does not *directly* focus on adversarial robustness as its primary goal. It's more broadly concerned with robustness to distribution shifts.\n*   The analysis is primarily conducted on VLMs, not standard image classification models.\n*   While it cites recent papers, it doesn't provide an in-depth survey of *all* recent work in adversarial robustness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper doesn't directly address adversarial robustness in image classification, it provides valuable insights into the use of test-time adaptation as a potential defense mechanism against distribution shifts, including those that might arise from adversarial attacks. It highlights the importance of techniques that prevent catastrophic forgetting and promote stable adaptation, and it showcases the application of these techniques to vision-language models."

This involves creating auxiliary tasks or losses that the model can use to adapt to the target domain without needing labeled data. Examples include minimizing entropy, and using normalizing flows.\n\n3.  **Fourier Domain Manipulation:** Adapting images in the frequency domain (using Fourier transforms) is emerging as a viable technique for domain adaptation and, consequently, improving robustness. This involves modifying the amplitude or phase components of the image's frequency spectrum.\n\n4.  **Consistency Regularization:** Enforcing consistency in the model's predictions or feature representations under various transformations (e.g., perturbations, style changes) is a popular approach.\n\n5.  **Single Image TTA:** There's growing interest in methods that can adapt to new domains using only a single test image, which is particularly relevant when batch processing is not feasible or desirable.\n\n6.  **Use of Diffusion Models:** Diffusion models are being explored for TTA to project the test image back to the source domain.\n\n**Limitations of the Analysis:**\n\n*   **Paper's Bias:** This analysis is inherently limited by the scope and focus of *this specific paper*. The authors may have chosen to highlight certain trends while omitting others. It is important to cross-reference this with other surveys and research to get a more complete picture.\n*   **Completeness of References:** The references cited by the paper may not be fully comprehensive of all the work done in the field within the last two years."

      "summary": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided paper and extracted information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Assessment**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on evaluating the robustness of CLIP models across various dimensions, including visual factors, out-of-distribution detection, predictive uncertainty, zero-shot retrieval, 3D awareness, and vision-language encoder interaction. While it touches upon adversarial robustness, it's not the central theme. However, some sections and findings are relevant.\n\n**Key Relevant Information (Last 2 Years)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the trends and specific findings related to adversarial robustness, as presented in the paper:\n\n1.  **Adversarial Robustness as a Motivation:**\n\n*   The paper explicitly mentions adversarial classification robustness as a motivating factor in the *Introduction*. It notes that contemporary research has delved into various facets of CLIP models, *including* adversarial classification robustness [11].  This indicates that adversarial robustness is recognized as an important area of study for CLIP models.\n\n2.  **Visual Factor-Level Robustness:**\n\n*   The study introduces the concept of \"visual factor-level effective robustness.\" This explores how well CLIP models perform when faced with variations in specific visual factors such as pose, background, and object scale. Although not strictly adversarial, these variations can be seen as a form of natural or semantic \"attack\" that tests the model's ability to generalize.\n*   The paper finds that CLIP models are generally *more* robust than ImageNet models on factors like `Subcategory`, `Smaller`, `Color`, `Shape`, `Texture`, and `Larger`.  However, they are *less* robust on `Pose` and `Partial View`.  This reveals specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversarial attacks.\n\n3.  **Shape Bias and Texture Bias:**\n\n*   The paper explores the shape bias of CLIP models and notes they tend to be more shape-biased than other models. This means they rely more on shape cues than texture. However, this bias is *weakened after fine-tuning on ImageNet.* This shift in bias could make the model more vulnerable to certain types of adversarial attacks that target shape or texture specifically.\n\n4.  **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection and Adversarial Examples:**\n\n*   The research mentions the use of ImageNet-O [7] as an OOD dataset. ImageNet-O contains \"natural adversarial examples.\"  Evaluating OOD detection performance on this dataset provides insights into how well CLIP models can identify inputs that are deliberately designed to fool them.\n*   The paper finds that training source impacts the trend of CLIP, showing that the correlation trend between ID accuracy and OOD detection performance is largely dependent on the training source.\n\n5.  **3D Corruptions:**\n\n*   The paper examines robustness against 3D corruptions. While not directly related to traditional pixel-level adversarial attacks, 3D corruptions can represent real-world adversarial scenarios.\n*   The paper finds that CNN-based CLIP models demonstrate stronger robustness to 3D-related corruptions as corruption intensity increases compared to ViT-based CLIP models.\n\n6.  **Impact of Fine-Tuning:**\n\n*   The paper finds that fine-tuning can influence the shape bias and OOD detection ability of CLIP. Some fine-tuned CLIP models perform worse in OOD detection compared to their zero-shot counterparts.\n\n7.  **Dataset Curation:**\n\n*   The paper evaluates the impact of dataset curation techniques on robustness. It finds that dataset curation leads to consistent improvements not only in classification and retrieval but also across robustness tasks.\n\n**Specific Citations to Consider (Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe following citations within the paper are likely to be relevant to adversarial robustness trends (check their content directly):\n\n*   \\[11] Y.

Li, \u201cHow does fine-tuning impact out-of-distribution detection for vision-language models?\u201d International Journal on Computer Vision, 2023\n\n**Trends Indicated by the Paper (regarding adversarial robustness specifically):**\n\n*   **Evaluation of Robustness Beyond Accuracy:** There's a trend toward evaluating robustness in a more nuanced way than just overall accuracy. This includes looking at performance on specific visual factors and considering out-of-distribution detection.\n*   **Importance of Training Data:**  The choice of training data distribution and the use of dataset curation techniques have a significant impact on the adversarial robustness (or related robustness measures) of CLIP models.\n*   **Fine-tuning Trade-offs:** Fine-tuning can improve accuracy but may negatively impact other aspects of robustness, such as OOD detection and shape bias.  Careful consideration of the fine-tuning strategy is needed.\n*   **Architectural Considerations:** The architecture of the visual encoder (CNN vs. Transformer) affects robustness to specific types of \"attacks,\" such as 3D corruptions and correspondence matching.\n*   **Vision-Language Model Interactions:** The interaction between the vision and language components in models like LLaVA influences classification performance, especially when the visual input is challenging.\n\n**Limitations of the Information:**\n\n*   **Indirect Focus:** The paper's primary focus is *not* on developing novel adversarial defense mechanisms.  It's more about *evaluating* the existing robustness of CLIP models.\n*   **CLIP-Centric:** The findings are primarily about CLIP models. Generalizing these trends to *all* image classification models would require further research.\n*   **\"Natural\" Adversarial Examples:** The paper leans more towards robustness against \"natural\" distribution shifts and corruptions rather than explicitly crafted, pixel-level adversarial examples.\n*    **Limited Scope:** While it mentions adversarial robustness in the introduction and references some work, it doesn't deeply explore recent techniques used to improve adversarial robustness for image classification.\n\nIn summary, while this paper doesn't directly provide a comprehensive overview of the latest *techniques* for improving adversarial robustness, it does highlight important trends in how robustness is being *evaluated* in the context of CLIP models, and it identifies several factors that influence a model's susceptibility to different types of perturbations and attacks.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on techniques from the last 2 years:\n\n**Summary of Relevant Techniques**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on improving the classification accuracy and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for SAR imagery. While not explicitly focused on *adversarial* robustness in the traditional sense (i.e., robustness against small, intentional perturbations to input images designed to fool the classifier), the techniques employed to enhance generalization and OOD detection are relevant to making the model more robust in general, which is related to adversarial robustness. Here's how:\n\n*   **Data Augmentation:** The paper uses various data augmentation techniques during training, including random rotations, color jitter, flipping, random cropping, and CutOut. These techniques are commonly used to improve the generalization ability of models, which can indirectly improve robustness against adversarial examples by making the model less sensitive to specific input features.\n*   **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** EMA is used to smooth model weights during training. This can help stabilize the training process and reduce the impact of noisy updates, potentially leading to a more robust model.\n*   **ReAct:** ReAct (Rectified Activations) is a post-hoc method applied during testing to enhance OOD detection. It involves clipping activation values at a predefined threshold in the penultimate layer of the network. The goal is to reduce the influence of anomalous data on model performance, which can also improve robustness against adversarial examples that generate unusual activations.\n*   **Test Time Augmentation (TTA):** TTA involves applying data augmentations to the input image during the testing phase and then averaging the predictions. This can improve the model's robustness by reducing its sensitivity to specific input variations.\n\n**Details of Relevant Techniques and Justifications**\n\n*   **Data Augmentation:**\n    *   **Techniques Used:** Random Rotation, Color Jitter, Flipping (horizontal and vertical), Random Crop, CutOut.\n    *   **Purpose:** Enhance data diversity, prevent overfitting, and improve generalization capability.\n*   **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Smooth model parameters during training to enhance stability.\n    *   **Decay Rate:** 0.99 (chosen for balance between stability and responsiveness).\n    *   **Equation:** `\u03b8t[ema] = \u03b2 \u00d7 \u03b8t[ema]-1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u00d7 \u03b8t`\n*   **ReAct (Rectified Activations):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Enhance OOD detection by clipping activations in the penultimate layer.\n    *   **Method:** `ReAct(x; c) = min(x, c)`, where `c` is a threshold.\n    *   **Threshold Selection:** Based on the *p*-th percentile of activations from in-distribution (ID) data. In their experiments, they explored `p = 0.6, 0.8, 0.9`.  `p=0.9` seemed to work best.\n    *   **How it Works:** Limits the effect of noise by truncating activations above the threshold `c`. Ideally, `c` is chosen to preserve activations for ID data while rectifying OOD data.\n*   **Energy Score:** Used in conjunction with ReAct to measure the model's uncertainty about the output. `Energy(x) = log\u03a3iexp(xi)`, where x denotes the output logits.  The negative energy score is used as the score function for OOD detection.\n*   **Test Time Augmentation (TTA):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Further enhance classification accuracy.\n    *   **Number of Iterations:** 32 (chosen empirically for a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency).  The accuracy plateaus beyond 32 iterations, suggesting diminishing returns.\n\n**Experimental Results Related to Robustness Enhancements**\n\nThe paper includes experimental results demonstrating the impact of each technique:\n\n*   **Table 1: Impact of Incremental Enhancements on Model Accuracy**\n    *   Shows how each component (+ Data Augmentation, + EMA, + ReAct, + TTA) incrementally improves classification accuracy.\n    *   Adding data augmentation increased accuracy from 96.40% to 97.00%.\n    *   Adding EMA increased accuracy from 97.00% to 97.30%.\n    *   Adding ReAct and Energy Score increased accuracy from 97.30% to 98.70%.\n    *   Adding TTA increased accuracy from 98.70% to 99.20%.\n*   **Table 2: Impact of EMA Decay Values on Classification Accuracy**\n    *   Shows the effect of different EMA decay values.\n    *   A decay value of 0.99 achieved the highest accuracy (99.20%).\n*   **Table 3: Effect of TTA Iterations on Classification Accuracy and Computational Efficiency**\n    *   Demonstrates the trade-off between TTA iterations, accuracy, and computational efficiency.\n    *   32 iterations provided a good balance.\n*   **Table 4: Impact of ReAct Method on Model Robustness and Accuracy**\n    *   Shows how ReAct improves OOD handling effectiveness. Higher `p` values in `ReAct(p)` seem to work better.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations**\n\n*   **Focus on OOD Detection:** The paper's primary focus is on OOD detection rather than explicitly addressing adversarial robustness. However, the techniques used are related and can contribute to a more robust model in general.\n*   **SAR Imagery Specific:** The methods are tailored for SAR imagery classification, so their direct applicability to other image classification tasks may vary.\n*   **Limited Exploration of Adversarial Attacks:** The paper doesn't include experiments evaluating the model's performance against specific adversarial attacks.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness (Inferred)**\n\nWhile the paper does not directly address adversarial robustness, the techniques it employs contribute to building more robust models:\n\n*   **Generalization:** Data augmentation and EMA improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, making it less susceptible to overfitting and potentially more resistant to adversarial examples.\n*   **OOD Detection:** ReAct helps the model identify and mitigate the influence of OOD samples, which can include adversarial examples that cause unusual activation patterns. By reducing the influence of such examples, the model becomes more reliable.\n*   **Stability:** EMA stabilizes the training process, reducing the impact of noisy updates and leading to more consistent model performance. This can make the model less vulnerable to adversarial perturbations.\n*   **Averaging Predictions:** TTA effectively averages the predictions over multiple augmented versions of the input image. This helps to mitigate the effect of any single adversarial perturbation, improving the overall robustness of the model.\n\n**In conclusion, while this paper does not directly test for adversarial robustness, it uses techniques (data augmentation, EMA, ReAct, and TTA) that could be beneficial in defending against adversarial attacks by increasing the model's generalization ability and stability.**"

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Summary of Relevant Information**\n\n*   **Focus of the Paper:** The paper investigates the *adversarial robustness* of the *Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure*, a widely used method for controlling the false detection rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing. It does *not* directly address image classification. It focuses on a more general statistical procedure used across various applications including some machine learning tasks.\n\n*   **Recent Trends in Adversarial Robustness (as context):** The paper *mentions* a growing body of literature on adversarial robustness, especially in the context of (deep) machine learning.

The adversary's goal is to perturb a limited number of p-values to maximize the false detection proportion (FDP) after the BH procedure is applied.\n\n*   **Perturbation Strategy (INCREASE-c):** The core of the paper is an algorithm called INCREASE-c. This algorithm strategically *increases* a limited number of null p-values to induce an expansion of the BH rejection region.  It aims to *increase* the number of false discoveries. A provably optimal algorithm MOVE-1 for c=1 is also discussed.\n\n*   **Key Findings (Adversarial Vulnerability):**\n\n    *   The paper demonstrates that BH can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks under certain conditions.  Specifically, if the alternative distributions are *close* to the null distribution (i.e., the differences between true and false hypotheses are small), even a small number of carefully crafted p-value perturbations can significantly break BH's FDR control.\n    *   The paper provides both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to support these findings. It gives lower bounds on the increase in FDR that an adversary can achieve with the INCREASE-c algorithm.\n\n*   **Relevant Theorems:**\n\n    *   **Theorem 3.2:** Quantifies the adversarially-adjusted FDR induced by INCREASE-c. It states that the adjusted FDR equals the original FDR plus a term (\u0394c) that represents the average increase in FDR due to the adversary's actions.\n\n    *   **Theorem 4.5:** Provides a lower bound (Lc) on the increase in FDR (\u0394c). This lower bound depends on parameters such as the desired control level (q), the number of tests (N), the number of true null hypotheses (N0), and the alternative distributions.\n    *   **Theorem 4.1:** Provides upper bounds and insights in the regime of high sub-uniformity.\n\n*   **Real-World Experiments:** A credit card fraud detection experiment is performed, showing that the INCREASE-c algorithm can increase the FDR above the desired control level in a real-world setting.\n\n*   **Limitations of the Study**\n    *   BH can lack adversarial robustness\n\n**Why this Paper is *Not* Directly Relevant to Image Classification**\n\n1.  **Focus on Statistical Hypothesis Testing:** The paper's focus is on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, a method from statistical hypothesis testing that is used to control the false discovery rate. While multiple hypothesis testing can be applied in machine learning, it is not the *primary* focus of research in adversarial robustness for image classification.\n2.  **Perturbation of P-values, Not Images:** The paper focuses on perturbing *p-values* directly, rather than manipulating *images* to fool a classifier.  Adversarial attacks in image classification involve modifying the input image in a way that is imperceptible to humans but causes the classifier to make an incorrect prediction.\n3.  **Different Goals:** The goal in the paper is to *break the FDR control* of the BH procedure. In image classification, the goal of an adversary is typically to *cause a misclassification*.\n4.  **No Image Data:** The paper deals with numerical data and credit card fraud detection (in experiments). There is no image data or image classifiers involved.\n5.  **Method:** Does not deal with the specifics of deep learning.\n\n**In conclusion, while the paper *touches* upon the broader concept of adversarial robustness, it does not directly address the specific trends and techniques used in adversarial robustness for *image classification*.

The paper highlights that prior defenses often excel in one or two of these aspects but struggle to balance all three. This three-way trade-off is a central problem.\n*   **PATCHCURE as a Framework:** The PATCHCURE framework itself represents a trend towards more flexible and adaptable defense mechanisms. It unifies Small Receptive Field (SRF) and Large Receptive Field (LRF) techniques, allowing for a tunable balance between robustness, utility, and efficiency. This unification is a novel approach.\n*   **Receptive Field Importance:** The paper identifies the *receptive field* of a vision model as a crucial factor in the robustness-utility-efficiency trade-off.  SRF defenses limit the impact of adversarial patches but can hurt model utility, while LRF defenses maintain utility but are computationally expensive.\n*   **ViT-SRF Architecture:** The development of the ViT-SRF architecture, a Vision Transformer variant with a small receptive field, highlights a trend in adapting Transformer-based models for robustness.  The goal is to achieve efficiency comparable to standard ViTs while improving robustness against patch attacks. This involves using local attention mechanisms.\n*   **Focus on Certifiable Robustness:** The paper emphasizes certifiable robustness, aiming to provide provable guarantees against attacks.  This contrasts with empirical defenses that lack such guarantees. Certifiable robustness is seen as a way to end the arms race between attackers and defenders. The paper underlines the importance of certification procedures (like `PCURE-CERTIFY`) that account for *all* possible attackers within a defined threat model.\n*   **Double Masking:** The use of double-masking (from PatchCleanser) as a secure operation is a notable technique for robust prediction recovery.\n\n**Specific Details Extracted from the Paper:**\n\n*   **Problem Definition:** Adversarial patch attacks involve adding a malicious patch to an image to cause misclassification. The goal is to design defenses (specifically, certifiably robust ones) to ensure correct classification even with the patch.\n*   **SRF vs. LRF Techniques:**\n    *   **SRF (Small Receptive Field) Defenses:**\n        *   Limit the number of features affected by the patch.\n        *   *Strength:* High efficiency.\n        *   *Weakness:* Can lead to poor model utility (accuracy).\n    *   **LRF (Large Receptive Field) Defenses:**\n        *   Aim to remove the patch from the input and then use a high-performance model.\n        *   *Strength:* High utility and robustness.\n        *   *Weakness:* Computationally expensive (requires multiple model feedforward passes).\n*   **PATCHCURE Algorithm Overview:**\n    1.  **Model Construction:** Splits a base model into SRF and LRF sub-models.\n    2.  **Model Inference:** Uses the SRF sub-model to extract features, then applies a secure operation (e.g., double-masking) with the LRF sub-model for prediction.\n    3.  **Robustness Certification:**  Certifies robustness using a procedure `PCURE-CERTIFY` that accounts for all possible attackers within the threat model.\n*   **ViT-SRF Implementation:** Uses local attention mechanisms to limit the receptive field. Local attention applies attention operations locally to sub-groups of visual tokens.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:**  The paper focuses on:\n    *   *Certifiable Robust Accuracy:* The fraction of test images for which the certification procedure returns `True`.\n    *   *Model Utility:* Clean accuracy (accuracy on unperturbed images).\n    *   *Computation Efficiency:* Inference throughput (images processed per second).\n*   **Comparison with Prior Defenses:**  The paper compares PATCHCURE to several existing certifiably robust defenses, including:\n    *   Clipped BagNet (CBN)\n    *   De-Randomized Smoothing (DRS)\n    *   PatchGuard\n    *   BagCert\n    *   PatchCleanser\n    *   Smoothed ViT (S-ViT) / ECViT / ViP (grouped as DRS+ViT)\n*   **Key Results:**\n    *   PATCHCURE can achieve state-of-the-art efficiency.\n    *   PATCHCURE provides a systematic way to balance the trade-off.\n    *   PATCHCURE can outperform prior efficient defenses in terms of robustness and utility.\n*   **MASKPRED Algorithm**\n    *   Enumerate every mask m in set M\n    *   Evaluate masked prediction \u0177 = Mlrf(f \u2299 m)\n*   **CERT-SO Algorithm**\n    *   Ensures mask set is R-covering\n    *   Mlrf(f \u2299 m0 \u2299 m1) != y means possibly vunerable\n*   **|M| equation**\n    *   |Mm,s,n| = |I| = \\lceil \\frac{n-m}{s} \\rceil + 1\n\n**Papers Referenced Within the Last Two Years (based on the reference list):**\n\n*   \\[6] Chen, Z., Li, B., Wu, S., Xu, J., Ding, S., & Zhang, W.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper \"PAD: Patch-Agnostic Defense against Adversarial Patch Attacks\" with a focus on extracting information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**I. Paper Overview & Relevance**\n\n*   **Core Focus:** This paper presents a defense mechanism against adversarial patch attacks, which are a significant threat to object detection systems. It introduces a \"patch-agnostic defense\" (PAD) that doesn't rely on prior knowledge of specific attacks.\n*   **Relevance to Research Question:** While the paper itself doesn't *directly* survey recent trends, it:\n    *   Positions itself within the context of existing defenses (providing a snapshot of the field).\n    *   Cites and compares against other defense methods (offering insights into the direction of research).\n    *   Is published very recently (so is itself a recent contribution).\n    *   It covers object detection but this is tightly linked with image classification.\n*   **Key Takeaway:** The paper suggests a trend away from attack-specific defenses and towards more general, robust methods that exploit inherent characteristics of adversarial patches.\n\n**II. Extracted Information Related to Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Last 2 Years)**\n\nHere's what the paper reveals about recent trends and related work, filtered for relevance and the time constraint (2022-2024, given current year is 2024):\n\n1.  **Focus on Patch-Agnostic Defenses:** The paper explicitly argues for and contributes to the trend of developing defenses that don't require prior knowledge of the attack.  It positions its PAD method as an improvement over methods that are tailored to specific attack types. This is motivated by the fact that new attack types are constantly emerging.\n2.  **Limitations of Adversarial Training:**\n    *   The paper notes that Adversarial Training, while popular, is not suitable for pre-trained models and requires significant resources for retraining when new attacks emerge. This suggests a trend where researchers are looking for more practical and efficient defense strategies.\n3.  **Weaknesses of Model-Specific Defenses:**\n    *   The paper highlights that some defense methods involve modifying specific models (e.g., YOLOv2). While these can achieve good results on those models, they don't generalize well to other object detectors. This reveals a trend away from model-dependent defenses and towards more universal approaches.\n4.  **Issues with Prior-Knowledge-Based Defenses:**\n    *   The paper criticizes entropy-based defenses (like Jedi [42]) for requiring prior knowledge of the entropy distribution of clean datasets and patch areas. This suggests a trend towards defenses that are less reliant on assumptions about the input data.\n5.  **Efficacy and Drawbacks of Certified Robust Defenses:**\n    *   Mentions that \"certifiably robust defenses\" (e.g., DetectorGuard [46], ObjectSeeker [50]) are being explored. However, it notes limitations:\n        *   DetectorGuard [46] only raises an alert and causes \"loss of model functionality\" during attacks, which is undesirable.\n        *   ObjectSeeker [50] struggles with large patch proportions or multiple patches.  The paper states it \"can only defend against hiding attacks, and the assumption does not hold when encountering multiple patches.\"\n6.  **Specific Defense Techniques Mentioned (with relevant citations):**\n    *   **Segmentation-based Defenses:** *SAC (Segment and Complete)* [28] (CVPR 2022) is presented as a recent approach that trains an external segmentation network to locate noise-like regions. However, the paper notes that SAC struggles with natural-looking patches.\n    *   **Entropy-based defenses:** *Jedi* [42] (CVPR 2023) is described as using entropy to locate patch areas.\n    *   **Certified Robustness:**  *ObjectSeeker* [50] (IEEE SP 2023) certifiably robust object detection against patch hiding attacks via patch-agnostic masking.\n    *   **Adversarial Training** [13, 20, 32, 34, 40, 44, 55]\n    *   **Model Modification** [21, 23, 39, 54]\n    *   **Patch Area Elimination** [7, 9, 10, 14, 28, 33, 38, 42, 52]\n7.  **Dataset trends:** The paper uses APRICOT [5] and other physical adversarial patch datasets to evaluate the robustness against physical attacks.\n8.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Attack Success Rate (ASR) and mean Average Precision (mAP) at Intersection over Union (IoU) 0.5 are used to measure robustness. The paper introduces Patch Localization Recall as well.\n\n**III. Synthesis of Trends**\n\nBased on the paper, here's a synthesized view of recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (and object detection):\n\n*   **Moving Beyond Attack-Specific Solutions:** A key trend is a shift away from defenses that are tailored to specific attack types. The field is moving towards methods that are more general and can handle a wider range of attacks, including those not seen during training.\n*   **Exploiting Inherent Patch Properties:** Recent research explores defenses that exploit inherent characteristics of adversarial patches, such as high-frequency noise, semantic inconsistencies, or spatial heterogeneity. PAD contributes to this trend.\n*   **Balancing Robustness and Functionality:** There's a recognition that some defenses (e.g., simply masking everything) can harm the functionality of the model.  The goal is to achieve robustness without significantly degrading performance on clean data.\n*   **Addressing Physical Attacks:** A growing area of focus is defending against physical adversarial attacks, which are more challenging than digital attacks.  This involves considering factors like lighting, viewing angle, and printing artifacts.\n*   **The rise of Certified Robustness** Certified robustness is a growing field to ensure the model is secure against attacks with mathematical guarantees.\n\n**IV. Limitations**\n\n*   **Focus on Object Detection:** The paper is primarily focused on object detection, although this is strongly related to image classification and the insights are relevant.\n*   **Indirect Trend Analysis:** The paper doesn't explicitly survey the literature, so the trend analysis is based on the authors' framing of their work and the papers they cite.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper is a valuable source of information on recent trends in adversarial robustness, particularly the move towards patch-agnostic defenses and the challenges of defending against physical attacks."

      "relevancy": "This paper focuses on defending against adversarial patch attacks in the context of object detection in UAVs, a specific application of image classification, and thus relevant to the broader research question of adversarial robustness. It was published this year.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper focusing on adversarial robustness for image classification, particularly considering its relevance to the research question and the \"last 2 years\" constraint (since the current year is 2024, we're looking at 2022-2024).\n\n**Paper Summary and Relevance:**\n\nThis paper primarily focuses on defending against adversarial patch attacks on object detection systems used in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  While not directly addressing image classification in general, it presents a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks that *can* be adapted or inform research in broader image classification contexts.  The techniques are model-agnostic, which is a significant trend.\n\n**Key Findings and Contributions (Relevant to Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   **Model-Agnostic Defense:** The paper's central contribution is a novel, model-agnostic defense mechanism against adversarial patches.  This means the defense doesn't rely on specific knowledge of the attacked object detection model, nor does it need retraining when the object detection model is changed.  This is achieved by formulating the defense as an occlusion removal task.\n\n*   **Occlusion Removal as Defense:** The approach treats adversarial patches as occlusions and uses a thin convolutional autoencoder (Attention U-Net) to reconstruct the image, effectively removing or mitigating the patch's impact.\n\n*   **UAV Object Detection Impact Assessment:** The paper assesses the impact of adversarial patches on UAV object detectors.  Experiments show that adversarial patches can significantly affect object detection performance in UAVs, achieving up to an 84% attack success rate (ASR). This highlights the vulnerability of these systems.\n\n*   **Attack Success Ratio (ASR) Reduction:** The defense mechanism is shown to reduce the ASR of adversarial patch attacks by approximately 30% on average.  It also reduces the impact of non-adversarial patch occlusions.\n\n*   **Low Processing Cost:** The defense mechanism is designed to be lightweight, incurring only a small additional processing cost (around 4% per image) on the detection pipeline. This is crucial for resource-constrained UAV deployments.\n\n*   **Physical Domain Feasibility:**  Experiments in a controlled physical environment demonstrate the potential of the defense mechanism to work in real-world scenarios.\n\n**Details on the Defense Mechanism:**\n\n*   **Attention U-Net Autoencoder:** The defense utilizes an Attention U-Net autoencoder architecture.  The encoder is based on a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 backbone.  The architecture is modified to be lightweight by discarding the top-level feature map and including a high-resolution map. The decoder has a 5-level configuration with 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 filters, respectively.\n\n*   **Training Data:** The autoencoder is trained on the VisDrone dataset.  To simulate adversarial patches during training, textures from the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) are applied to objects in the images. The choice of DTD is based on the rationale that adversarial patches often resemble textures.\n\n*   **Loss Function:** The model uses a pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to encourage reconstruction of the original image.\n\n**Relevance to Trends in Adversarial Robustness (2022-2024):**\n\n*   **Model-Agnostic Defenses:** This paper aligns with the trend of developing model-agnostic defenses. As noted in the paper, retraining a model for every object detection pipeline is not practical. The move towards more generalizable defenses is a key focus in the field.\n*   **Image Restoration/Inpainting Techniques:** Using image restoration/inpainting techniques (like autoencoders) as a defense mechanism is also a growing area. This represents a shift from purely adversarial training to leveraging generative models to \"clean\" or repair corrupted inputs.\n*   **Focus on Real-World Deployments:** The paper's consideration of processing costs and physical domain experiments reflects a growing emphasis on the practicality and deployability of adversarial defenses. Many earlier defenses were computationally expensive and difficult to translate to real-world settings. The development of a tiny single-stage defense mechanism helps in deployment onboard UAVs.\n*   **Defense Against Patch Attacks:** Adversarial patch attacks remain a relevant threat, and research into defenses specifically targeting these attacks continues to be important.\n\n**Specific Citations (Potentially Relevant):**\n\nWhile many references are older, a few within the paper *may* be relevant if you look up the papers they cite:\n\n*   **[4] M.

Mentions Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients as possible alternatives.\n    *   **Average Filtering:** Pre-processes the saliency map with average filtering to enhance the adversarial patch region and downplay benign features. This is important for *robust* detection.\n    *   **Guided Feature Transplantation:**  Transfers suspicious features to the *least-salient* regions of a hold-out input to determine if they trigger misclassification. This reduces false positives.\n    *   **Prediction Comparison:** Compares prediction labels on the original and hold-out images.  An image is considered adversarial if and only if both images yield the *same* prediction label.\n*   **Attack Mitigation Methodology:**\n    *   **GAN-based Localized Attack Mitigation:** Employs GANs (specifically PICnet, but mentions other possibilities) to reconstruct the semantic content of the masked patch region.\n    *   **Parametric Attack Mitigation:** Introduces a strategy to mask only a *percentage* of the suspected features, balancing detection performance and FPR.  Finds that targeted misclassification can often be made ineffective without completely recovering the entire patch.\n    *   **FPR Reduction:**  Signals a false positive when the prediction label on the original and recovered input is identical during the mitigation phase.\n\n**Experimental Results and Comparisons:**\n\n*   Evaluated on ImageNet, ImageNette, CelebA, and Place365 datasets.\n*   Compared Jujutsu to LGS (Localized Gradient Smoothing), SentiNet, PatchGuard and adversarial training.\n*   Demonstrated superior detection and mitigation performance compared to existing defenses:\n    *   Higher detection recall\n    *   Higher robust accuracy (accuracy on adversarial examples)\n    *   Lower false positive rate (FPR)\n*   Showed that Jujutsu can defend against physical-world attacks (printed adversarial patches).\n*   Evaluated against adaptive attacks attempting to evade detection and mitigation.\n    *   Adaptive attacks that manipulate saliency maps significantly degrade the attack's success rate when Jujutsu is in place.\n    *   Adaptive attacks attempting to survive partial masking are thwarted by increasing the masking percentage in Jujutsu.\n\n**Evaluation on More DNN Models**\n* Wide-ResNet\n* DenseNet121\n* SqueezeNet\n* VGG16\n* ResNet-152\n* GoogleNet\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n*   Overhead in detection and mitigation.\n*   Performance dependent on the GAN's image inpainting capabilities (PICnet).\n*   Focused on single-patch attacks (but provides an extension for multi-patch).\n*   Assumes knowledge of the patch shape.\n*   Primarily focused on targeted attacks.\n\n**Implications for Trends in Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Patch Attacks:** The paper highlights the growing importance of defending against patch attacks, which are robust and practical.\n2.  **Importance of Detection:** Demonstrates that effective defenses require accurate *detection* of adversarial examples, not just mitigation.  This includes not only identifying AEs but also *localizing* the adversarial perturbation.\n3.  **GANs for Reconstruction:**  Shows the potential of using GANs for reconstructing clean images from adversarial examples, improving robust accuracy.\n4.  **Balancing Detection and Mitigation:** The parametric mitigation strategy emphasizes the need for defenses that can be tuned to balance different performance metrics (detection rate, FPR, accuracy).\n5.  **Saliency Maps as a Defense Tool:**  Uses saliency maps for adversarial detection, but also acknowledges the possibility of adaptive attacks that manipulate saliency maps. This suggests that robustness to saliency map manipulation is an important consideration.\n6.  **Adaptive Attack Evaluation:** The paper stresses the necessity of evaluating defenses against adaptive attackers who specifically try to circumvent the defense mechanism.\n7.  **Trade-offs:** The work recognizes and explores inherent trade-offs in defense strategies, especially between robustness and clean accuracy, and detection rate and FPR.\n\nIn essence, the paper contributes to the trend of developing more sophisticated, multi-stage defenses that combine detection and mitigation strategies while considering adaptive attackers. The use of GANs for image reconstruction and the parametric approach for balancing performance metrics are notable contributions."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**I. General Trends and Insights from the Paper:**\n\n*   **Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Adversarial Vulnerability:** The paper acknowledges ViTs' dominance in computer vision, but emphasizes their vulnerability to adversarial attacks as a significant challenge. This aligns with a key trend in the field \u2013 addressing the inherent weaknesses of these powerful models.\n*   **Importance of Mechanistic Understanding:** The paper stresses the need for a mechanistic understanding of how adversarial perturbations affect ViTs, particularly at the layer level. This highlights a shift toward not just developing defenses, but also understanding *why* attacks work and *how* models fail.\n*   **Propagation of Adversarial Effects:** A key finding is that adversarial effects, though subtle initially, propagate and amplify through ViT layers, becoming most pronounced in the middle to later layers.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper, focusing on adversarial robustness trends in image classification, and specifically addressing the question of \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Note:** This paper was published in 2022. Therefore, only references from 2021 and 2022 will be considered as the \"latest trends\"\n\n**I. Overall Focus of the Paper**\n\n*   The paper investigates the adversarial robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained using a self-supervised method called DINO. This is compared against supervised ViTs and traditional CNNs (ResNet-50).\n*   It explores the vulnerability of DINO-trained ViTs to adversarial attacks, analyzes how these attacks affect the latent space of the ViTs, and evaluates the effectiveness of several defense strategies under limited computational resources.\n\n**II. Key Findings and Trends Related to Adversarial Robustness (from the last 2 years)**\n\n1.  **Vision Transformers Vulnerability:**\n    *   The paper confirms that ViTs, even those trained with self-supervision (DINO), are vulnerable to adversarial attacks like FGSM, PGD, and C&W. This aligns with the broader understanding that even state-of-the-art architectures are susceptible.\n\n2.  **Transferability of Attacks:**\n    *   Self-supervision (DINO) *increases* the transferability of adversarial attacks between ViTs and CNNs. This is a somewhat concerning trend, as it suggests that attacks crafted on one type of model are more likely to be successful on another when self-supervised learning is involved.\n    *   This contrasts somewhat with previous findings (referencing Naseer et al., 2022) that supervised ViTs have limited transferability to convolutional models.  This means that attacks made on supervised ViTs don't transfer well to CNNs, but attacks on DINO ViTs *do* transfer.\n\n3.  **Latent Space Analysis:**\n    *   The paper analyzes the latent space of DINO ViTs under attack, finding that:\n        *   Adversarial inputs *can* be separated from original (clean) images in the latent space.\n        *   Adversarial images tend to stay close to their original (true) class in the latent space, even though they are misclassified.\n        *   Adversarial examples remain separable within the clusters of the latent space.\n    *   These observations suggest that the latent space contains information useful for detecting and classifying adversarial examples, motivating the use of post-hoc detectors.\n\n4.  **Defense Strategies Under Limited Resources:** The study evaluates three defenses, with the core constraint of *not* retraining the entire Transformer backbone:\n\n    *   **Adversarial Training (AT):**\n        *   Adversarial training of *only* the classification head (while freezing the ViT backbone) can be effective for small perturbations, but performance collapses as the strength of the attack increases. This is attributed to the limited representational power when the Transformer is frozen.\n    *   **Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT):**\n        *   EAT, where training data is augmented with adversarial examples transferred from a *surrogate* model, proves to be more effective. Specifically, training with PGD attacks (epsilon = 0.03) on the surrogate yields a model that generalizes well against various attacks, albeit with a slight decrease in accuracy on clean samples.\n        *   EAT shows better robustness against attacks crafted on a larger ViT architecture, highlighting its potential for improving transferability defense.\n    *   **Ensemble of Specialized Networks:**\n        *   This approach uses a post-hoc detector to identify adversarial examples in the latent space.  Based on the detector's output, either a \"clean\" classifier or an \"adversarial\" classifier is used.\n        *   This ensemble method achieves good accuracy against various attacks, but the performance drops for C&W attacks compared to EAT.\n\n**III. Specific References to Recent Work (Last 2 Years):**\n\n*   **(Caron et al., 2021):** Introduced DINO (Self-Supervised Vision Transformers). The paper uses this model as the foundation for its analysis.\n*   **(Bao et al., 2021):** Proposed BEiT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers), another self-supervised training framework for ViTs.\n*   **(He et al., 2021):** Introduced Masked Autoencoders, another framework for self-supervised learning.\n*   **(Khan et al., 2021):** Survey of Transformers in Vision.\n*   **(Mosca et al., 2022):**  Work on detecting NLP adversarial attacks by interpreting logits variation.\n*   **(Naseer et al., 2022):**  Research on improving adversarial transferability of vision transformers, finding limited transferability between supervised ViTs and CNNs.\n\n**IV. Implications for Current Trends**\n\n*   The study underscores the importance of considering self-supervised learning in the context of adversarial robustness. While self-supervision offers benefits for representation learning, it can also inadvertently increase the transferability of attacks.\n*   The focus on defense strategies with limited computational resources is highly relevant, given the practical constraints in many real-world deployments. Ensemble methods, particularly EAT and specialized networks leveraging latent space properties, show promise in this regard.\n*   The paper highlights the potential of latent space analysis for understanding and mitigating adversarial attacks. Exploring the properties of latent spaces and how they are affected by perturbations is a promising area of research.\n\n**V. Limitations and Future Directions (as outlined in the paper):**\n\n*   **Limited Dataset:**  The study uses a reduced ImageNet dataset, so the generalizability of the findings to the full ImageNet dataset is unknown.\n*   **Adversarial Training:**  Further research is needed to explore whether unfreezing layers in the encoder during adversarial training can improve robustness against stronger attacks.\n*   **Ensemble Adversarial Training:** Optimizing the augmentation of training data is another area for improvement.\n*   **Self-Supervision Strategies:** Evaluating other self-supervision strategies to see if similar properties and defenses apply.\n*   **Adaptive Attacks:**  The defenses need to be tested against adaptive attacks.\n*   **Latent Space Exploration:**  Further exploration is needed into the information present in the latent space.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper contributes to the understanding of adversarial robustness in ViTs, particularly those trained with self-supervision. It highlights the vulnerability of these models, the increased transferability of attacks with DINO, and the potential of ensemble-based defenses under resource constraints. The analysis of latent space properties offers valuable insights for developing more effective detection and mitigation techniques. The reference to papers published in 2021 and 2022 makes the analysis relevant to current research trends in the field."

      "relevancy": "This paper is a survey on adversarial attacks and defenses on text-to-image diffusion models. While it focuses on text-to-image models, it provides relevant context on adversarial robustness within the last two years.",
      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided paper \"Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models: A Survey\" to address your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information:\n\n**Overall Relevance:**\n\nThis paper is *marginally* relevant to the research question. While it focuses on adversarial robustness, its primary focus is on *text-to-image* diffusion models, *not* image classification models. However, some concepts and techniques discussed *could* potentially be transferable or relevant in a broader sense to adversarial robustness in image classification.  The paper was submitted before June 1, 2024.\n\n**Key Sections and Information:**\n\n*   **Introduction:**  The introduction sets the stage by highlighting the vulnerabilities of text-to-image diffusion models in terms of *robustness* and *safety*.  While the context is text-to-image, the underlying concept of robustness (model's ability to generate consistent semantics despite input variations) is directly relevant to image classification. It mentions two types of vulnerability: 1) inaccurate images against the prompt with multiple objects and attributes and 2) lack of robustness to grammatically incorrect prompts with subtle noise.\n\n*   **Section 3: Attacks:** This section is the most pertinent. It provides a taxonomy and detailed analysis of adversarial attacks on text-to-image models. While the attacks are tailored for the text-to-image domain, understanding the *types* of attacks, the *perturbation strategies*, and the *attacker's knowledge* can be valuable for understanding general trends in adversarial machine learning.\n\n    *   **Taxonomy of Adversarial Attacks (Section 3.1):**\n        *   **Targeted vs. Untargeted:** This distinction is fundamental in adversarial robustness. Targeted attacks aim to cause a specific misclassification, while untargeted attacks aim to simply reduce the model's accuracy.\n        *   **Perturbation (Character-level, Word-level, Sentence-level):**  The granularity of the adversarial perturbation is a key characteristic. This translates to image classification as well (e.g., pixel-level, patch-level).\n        *   **Knowledge (White-box vs. Black-box):** This describes the attacker's knowledge of the model. White-box attacks assume full knowledge, while black-box attacks rely only on the model's input-output behavior.\n\n    *   **Untargeted Attacks (Section 3.2):**  This section discusses attacks designed to reveal robustness vulnerabilities. Even though it's in the context of text prompts, the *goal* is the same as in image classification: to find inputs that cause the model to produce incorrect or inconsistent outputs. This section includes the ATM attack [22] and the Zhuang et al. attack [23].\n        *   **White-box Attacks (Section 3.2.1):**  This describes attacks where the attacker has full access to the model's internals. ATM [22] identifies that the model often generates inaccurate images against prompts with multiple objects and attributes. Zhuang et al. [23] minimized the cosine similarity between adversarial and clean prompts in the CLIP embedding space.\n        *   **Black-box Attacks (Section 3.2.2):** Gao et al. [24] used character-level perturbations to modify the prompt.\n        *   **Summary of Untargeted Attacks (Section 3.2.3):** This section identifies that the model is vulnerable to complex prompts, grammatically incorrect prompts, and prompts with noise.\n    *   **Targeted Attacks (Section 3.3):** This section describes attacks that aim to circumvent safety mechanisms. Understanding how these attacks work (e.g., bypassing filters) *might* offer insights into defense strategies that could be applicable in other domains.\n\n*   **Section 4: Defenses:** This section reviews defense methods against the identified attacks. Again, while specific to text-to-image models, some general defense principles (e.g., external safeguards like input filtering, internal safeguards like modifying model parameters) *could* be relevant to image classification.\n\n    *   **Defense for Safety (Section 4.2):**\n        *   **External Safeguards (Section 4.2.1):** Latent Guard [40] uses prompt classification. POSI [41] and GuardT2I [42] focus on prompt transformation.\n        *   **Internal Safeguards (Section 4.2.2):**  Model editing (modifying parameters) and inference guidance (modifying features during inference).\n        *   **Model Editing:** AC [44], DT [98], and SA [106] align the latent noise.\n        *   **Inference Guidance:** SLD [71] and Li et al. [48] modify internal features of the model during the inference stage.\n\n*   **Section 7: Challenges and Future Directions:** This section is important. It discusses the limitations of current attacks and defenses, and suggests potential solutions. These challenges are often common across different machine learning domains.\n\n    *   **Imperceptibility of Adversarial Attack (Section 7.1):**\n        *   **Untargeted Attacks:** Uses character-level perturbations\n        *   **Targeted Attacks:** Uses grammatically correct prompts.\n    *   **Defense Effectiveness against Adversarial Attacks (Section 7.2):**  This discusses the deficiencies in current defenses, such as their inability to handle subtle noise or defend against all types of adversarial prompts.\n\n*   **References:**  The references are a crucial resource.  You would need to filter these based on the publication date (last 2 years) and relevance to *image classification* (rather than text-to-image).  Look for papers on adversarial training, robust optimization, certified defenses, and other techniques used to improve robustness.\n\n**Specific Relevant Trends (Extracted and Filtered):**\n\nBased on the paper, and considering the focus on the last 2 years, here are some trends that *might* be relevant to image classification adversarial robustness (after careful filtering and interpretation):\n\n1.  **Emphasis on Imperceptible Attacks:** The paper highlights the need for attacks that are difficult to detect.  This is a major trend.\n2.  **Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Attack Generation:**  The trend of using LLMs to craft more sophisticated adversarial examples, particularly to bypass defenses, is notable and could inspire research in image classification. For example, can LLMs be used to generate adversarial *image* perturbations or to optimize attacks?\n3.  **Model Editing for Defense:** (Within the text-to-image domain, specifically) The concept of surgically modifying a model to remove vulnerabilities is relevant to image classification. Research on techniques like \"certified defenses\" or \"robust optimization\" might share similar goals.\n4.  **External vs. Internal Defenses:** The categorization of defenses into external (input filtering) and internal (model modification) is a broad trend.  This is useful for organizing defense strategies in image classification as well.  For instance, adversarial training is an internal defense, while input sanitization or anomaly detection would be external defenses.\n5.  **The difficulty of defending against all types of adversarial prompts:** The rapid advancement of adversarial attacks makes this a challenge.\n\n**How to Use This Information for Your Research Question:**\n\n1.  **Filter the References:** Start by going through the paper's references. Identify the papers that are: a) published in the last 2 years, and b) related to adversarial robustness, and c) ideally focused on, or at least relevant to, *image classification*.\n2.  **Look for Transferable Concepts:** Even if a paper is in the text-to-image domain, see if the *techniques* or *insights* can be applied to image classification. For example, a novel loss function used for adversarial training in text-to-image could potentially be adapted for image classification.\n3.  **Focus on the Challenges and Future Directions:** Pay close attention to Section 7 of the paper. The challenges discussed (e.g., imperceptibility, defense effectiveness) are often universal in adversarial machine learning. Use these challenges to guide your search for more specific papers on image classification.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   The paper is primarily a *survey* of the text-to-image domain. It does not present novel research in image classification.\n*   The relevance to image classification is indirect. The paper provides a general overview of the adversarial landscape and can inform research into adversarial robustness for image classification.\n*   The paper may contain offensive or distressing material.\n\nIn summary, while this paper is not a direct answer to your research question, it provides a useful background and points to some potentially relevant trends in adversarial robustness. The key is to use the references and the challenges discussed to guide your search for papers specifically focused on image classification."

      "summary": "Okay, I will extract the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Guided Diffusion Model for Adversarial Purification\n\n**Key Aspects Related to Adversarial Robustness (last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Trend: Adversarial Purification using Diffusion Models:**\n\n    *   The paper presents a novel adversarial purification approach called \"Guided Diffusion Model for Purification (GDMP)\". This falls under the trend of using generative models for adversarial defense, specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs).\n    *   DDPMs are used to purify attacked images before feeding them to classifiers. The diffusion process adds noise to the adversarial image, submerging the perturbation, and the reverse process denoises the image, removing both the added noise and the adversarial perturbation.\n    *   The use of DDPMs is motivated by their ability to retain more local details compared to other generative models like GANs or VAEs, as the latent space has the same dimension as the input image.\n\n2.  **Trend: Guiding the Purification Process:**\n\n    *   A key contribution is the introduction of \"guidance\" during the denoising process. This addresses the trade-off between removing adversarial perturbations and preserving the semantic content of the original clean image.\n    *   The guidance is implemented by encouraging the purified image to be close to the adversarial image (using MSE or SSIM as distance metrics) during the reverse diffusion process.  This leverages the fact that the adversarial image is close to the original clean image in pixel space.\n    *   The \"guidance scale\" is a critical hyperparameter, and the paper proposes a time-step dependent guidance scale that adapts based on the magnitude of Gaussian noise and adversarial perturbation at each diffusion step.\n\n3.  **Trend: Evaluation against Strong Adaptive Attacks:**\n\n    *   The paper emphasizes the importance of evaluating defenses against strong adaptive attacks, such as BPDA (Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation) and SPSA (Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation) to address potential obfuscated gradients caused by iterative purification processes.\n\n4. **Trend: Acceleration of DDPMs**\n    * The paper utilizes an acceleration method proposed by Nichol & Dhariwal (2021) involving skipping steps in the reverse diffusion process to speed up the purification\n\n5.  **Performance Highlights (as of the paper's writing):**\n\n    *   On CIFAR-10, GDMP achieves 90.1% robust accuracy under PGD attack (l\u221e \u03b5-ball with \u03b5= 8/255).\n    *   On ImageNet, GDMP achieves 70.94% robust accuracy with the PGD attack (l\u221e \u03b3-ball with \u03b3= 4/255), outperforming previous methods.\n\n**Related Works (within the last 2 years, as cited by the paper):**\n\nThe paper cites several works published within the last 2 years (2021-2023):\n\n*   **Bai et al. (2021)**: \"Are transformers more robust than cnns?\"\n*   **Dhariwal & Nichol (2021)**: \"Diffusion models beat gans on image synthesis.\"\n*   **Hill et al.

(2021)**: \"Adversarial purification with score-based generative models.\"\n\n**Summary of Trends from the Paper:**\n\nThe paper highlights a trend towards using diffusion models, particularly DDPMs, for adversarial purification.  A key element of this trend is not just *using* DDPMs, but *guiding* their denoising process to better preserve image content while removing adversarial perturbations. The evaluation against strong adaptive attacks and black-box attacks is essential to ensure the robustness of these defenses. The paper positions itself as advancing the state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness, particularly on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, using this guided diffusion approach.

      "relevancy": "This paper presents 'Center Smoothing' and extends certifiable robustness to problems with structured outputs, such as images, which is relevant to image classification and adversarial robustness.  The focus on robustness techniques makes this relevant to current trends in the area.  It also falls within the past two years.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to answer your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Center Smoothing: Certified Robustness for Networks with Structured Outputs\n\n**Key Information & Relevance to the Research Question:**\n\nWhile this paper *doesn't focus exclusively on image classification*, it introduces a relevant technique (\"Center Smoothing\") that *can be applied to image classification* and other tasks with structured outputs.  It's essential because it addresses the trend of *provable* adversarial robustness, which is critical for reliable defense. Here's the relevant breakdown:\n\n1.  **Focus on Provable Robustness:** The paper directly addresses a key trend: moving *beyond* empirical defenses to *provable/certified* defenses.  It emphasizes that empirical defenses are often broken by stronger attacks, while provable robustness offers guarantees regardless of attack improvements.  This is a *significant trend* because it tackles the fundamental insecurity of many deep learning models.\n\n2.  **Randomized Smoothing:** The research builds on *randomized smoothing*, a technique that has shown promise for scaling to high-dimensional inputs like images without requiring assumptions about the underlying model. Randomized smoothing itself is an established trend within adversarial robustness. The paper's contribution is extending this to more general output spaces.\n\n3.  **Extending Beyond Classification:**  A limitation of earlier provable robustness work (including randomized smoothing) was its focus on *classification tasks*.  This paper extends the scope of *certifiable robustness* to problems with *structured outputs* like images, sets, and language. This extension broadens the applicability of provable defenses to many other tasks.\n\n4.  **Center Smoothing Technique:** The core contribution is \"center smoothing.\"  Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n    *   **Idea:** Given an input `x`, sample many points in its neighborhood using a Gaussian smoothing distribution.\n    *   **Process:** Apply the original function `f` to each of these sampled points.\n    *   **Output:** Return the \"center\" of the smallest \"ball\" in the *output space* that contains at least half of the sampled outputs.\n    *   **Robustness Guarantee:** This smoothed function `f[\u00af]` (or `f[\u02c6]` for the practical approximation) is provably robust: a small change in the input `x` will result in a small change in the output `f[\u00af](x)`, as measured by a distance metric defined on the output space.\n\n5.  **Key aspects of Center Smoothing regarding trends:**\n\n    *   **Output Space Metric:** Central to this is the *choice of metric* in the *output space*.  Instead of just focusing on \"correct class,\" the paper allows you to define robustness in terms of how *similar* the output is to the original under perturbation.  Examples include total variation for images, intersection-over-union (IoU) for object localization, and perceptual distances. By allowing different metrics, the approach can be tailored to specific application requirements. This aligns with the trend towards more nuanced and application-specific robustness metrics.\n    *   **Relaxing Metric Requirements:** Center smoothing works even when the distance metric in the output space *doesn't perfectly satisfy all metric properties* (e.g., total variation distance). This is important because many useful similarity measures don't strictly meet the mathematical definition of a metric.\n\n6.  **Experimental Results & Image Classification Relevance:** The paper includes experiments on tasks beyond image classification. It uses image generation, face detection, and dimensionality reduction as examples, showing the broad applicability of the technique. Note:  While *not* pure image classification, the face detection example shows the method *can* be used to provide robustness guarantees on components used in image classification pipelines.  Specifically, it certifies the Jaccard distance (overlap) of bounding boxes generated by a face detector under adversarial input. The generative model experiment uses perceptual distance, a common metric for image quality. The total variation distance experiment demonstrates that the method works for dimensionality reduction and image reconstruction tasks when trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.\n\n7.  **Relationship to Other Smoothing Methods:** The paper acknowledges other randomized smoothing methods but emphasizes its advantages, particularly in handling structured outputs and resistance to outliers (because it uses the *center of a ball* rather than the *mean* of outputs).\n\n8.  **Limitations and Future Work:** The paper discusses the limitations of only focusing on \u21132-norm bounded adversaries and Gaussian smoothing.  It suggests future research into generalizing the method to other threat models (e.g., total variation distance, perceptual distance). This signals an understanding of the evolving threat landscape and the need for more flexible robustness techniques.\n\n**In summary, from this paper, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (and related tasks) include:**\n\n*   **Emphasis on Provable/Certified Robustness:** Moving beyond empirical defenses to methods that provide guarantees against *any* attack within a defined threat model.\n*   **Randomized Smoothing Techniques:** A popular approach for achieving provable robustness, scaling to high-dimensional data like images.\n*   **Extending Robustness to Structured Outputs:** Expanding the scope beyond just classification accuracy to consider the *quality* and *similarity* of outputs, using appropriate distance metrics.\n*   **Application-Specific Robustness Metrics:**  Tailoring robustness measures to the specific task and desired properties of the output (e.g., IoU for object detection, perceptual distance for image generation).\n*   **Relaxing Metric Assumptions:**  Developing methods that can work with a broader range of similarity measures, even if they don't strictly satisfy all metric properties.\n*   **Training with Noise:**  Improve the base model's robustness.\n\nThe core contribution of this paper, center smoothing, addresses these trends directly. It's a technique that leverages randomized smoothing to provide provable robustness for models with complex output spaces. While the paper doesn't focus exclusively on standard image classification, the techniques are broadly applicable and the experiments demonstrate its usefulness for image-related tasks."

It was also published within the last two years.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Important Note:** This paper *does not* focus primarily on image classification. It addresses a more general notion of adversarial robustness in group equivariant tasks, which *can* include image classification, but also extends to graphs, point clouds, molecules, etc.  Therefore, the \"trends\" it discusses are broader than just image classification.  Also the publication date of this paper is NeurIPS 2023, so this is in the last 2 years.\n\n**I. Core Idea & Contribution**\n\n*   **Problem Addressed:** Existing adversarial robustness measures (e.g., \u2113p distances) are not appropriate for tasks with group equivariance (e.g., molecular property prediction, point cloud segmentation). In these tasks, even large norm perturbations may not change semantic content, or the prediction *should* change in a specific way.\n*   **Proposed Solution:** A new notion of adversarial robustness for group equivariant tasks that:\n    *   Measures input similarity using group invariant distance functions.\n    *   Considers transformations of both the input and output spaces.\n*   **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Action-induced Distance:**  The core concept for measuring input similarity in group equivariant tasks. It's the distance after optimally aligning the perturbed input with the clean input via a group action. Mathematically: `d\u02c6in(x, x') = ming\u2208G din(x, g \u2022 x')`. Examples include:\n        *   *Point Cloud Registration Distance:* The distance after finding the optimal correspondence and rigid transformation (permutation, rotation, translation).\n        *   *Graph Edit Distance:*  The number of edges that need to be inserted or deleted to transform a graph into one isomorphic to another.\n    *   **Output Distance:**  Considers how predictions should transform for semantics-preserving input transformations.\n    *   **(G, din, dout, \u03f5, \u03b4)-equivariant-robustness:** A prediction `f(x)` is considered robust if it's robust to unnoticeable perturbations AND is approximately equivariant around `x`. This is formally defined in Definition 1.\n*   **Provable Robustness:** Achieved by:\n    *   Using models with equivariances that match the task's equivariances.\n    *   Certifying traditional adversarial robustness of these equivariant models.\n*   **Equivariance-Preserving Randomized Smoothing:** A framework developed to certify models with continuous equivariances (e.g., rotation equivariance). It specifies conditions under which models retain their equivariances when undergoing randomized smoothing.\n*   **Generalization of Graph Edit Distance Certificates:** Extends existing graph and node classification robustness certificates for \u21130 perturbations to graph edit distance perturbations with user-specified costs.\n\n**II. Key Findings and Trends**\n\n*   **Equivariant Models Facilitate Provable Robustness:** Using models with matching equivariances simplifies proving robustness in group equivariant tasks.  Existing robustness certification procedures for equivariant models (e.g., transformers, PointNet, graph convolutional networks) can be reused.  You just have to reinterpret what they actually certify (e.g., robustness to graph edit distance).  This is a *major* trend: leveraging geometric machine learning for robustness.\n*   **Equivariance-Preserving Randomized Smoothing Extends Applicability:** This framework allows certifying models with continuous equivariances (e.g., rotation) for which specialized certification procedures are unavailable. This leverages the trend of Randomized Smoothing but adapts it to maintain equivariance.  This means it can be used with a much wider range of architectures.\n*   **Importance of Task Equivariances:** The equivariances of the task influence what should be considered robust. In other words, robustness is not just about a constant prediction, but a *correctly transforming* prediction.\n*   **Beyond Invariance, Towards Equivariance:** A shift from focusing on *invariance* (predictions remaining constant) to *equivariance* (predictions transforming appropriately) in robust geometric machine learning.\n\n**III.

Experimental Results**\n\n*   **Point Cloud Classification:** High accuracy (above 80%) was achieved on ModelNet40. DGCNN showed significantly higher provable robustness than PointNet. Randomized Smoothing proves robust guarantees for equivariant tasks where discrete groups act on continuous data.\n*   **Molecular Force Prediction:** The DimeNet++ model was used and the method could provide guarantees on how much predicted force vectors would change for small perturbations. Equivariance-preserving randomized smoothing is effective for continuous groups acting on continuous data.\n*   **Node Classification:** It shows that increasing the cost for edge insertions significantly increased the provable robustness for the same budgets.\n\n**V. Limitations**\n\n*   The group equivariance framework doesn't capture all symmetries (e.g., local gauge equivariance, wave function symmetries).\n*   Non-equivariant models can sometimes have better empirical performance.\n*   Equivariant models can lose their equivariance in practice (e.g., due to image interpolation).\n*   The method requires *a priori* knowledge of task equivariances.\n*   Providing guarantees of the form (G, din, dout, \u03f5, \u03b4) requires a-priori knowledge that the task is equivariant to group G.\n\n**VI. Future Directions**\n\n*   Make equivariant models more robust to classic threat models *without* explicitly focusing on equivariance.\n*   Develop attacks, defenses, and certificates that are *equivariance-aware*.\n*   Develop procedures to certify *non-equivariant* models or models that are \"almost equivariant.\"\n\n**In summary,** the latest trends in adversarial robustness, as viewed from the perspective of this paper (published in 2023), involve:\n\n1.  **Exploiting Geometric Structure:**  Moving beyond pixel-level perturbations to consider transformations that preserve the underlying geometric or structural properties of the data.\n2.  **Leveraging Geometric Machine Learning:**  Using equivariant models and adapting existing robustness certification procedures for these models.\n3.  **Randomized Smoothing with Equivariance Preservation:** Using this to obtain provable robustness guarantees, especially for models where other certification methods are lacking.\n4.  **Re-interpreting Robustness:** Shifting the focus from \"predictions remain constant\" to \"predictions transform correctly\" under meaning-preserving transformations.\n\nRemember that this paper frames the problem more broadly than just image classification, but these trends are potentially applicable there as well, especially in tasks like image segmentation or object detection where geometric relationships are important."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the relevant content, focusing on trends evident in the paper and related works, and explicitly considering the timeframe:\n\n**Core Trend: Moving Beyond Standard Lp Norms (especially p > 1) and Exploring Fractional Lp Quasi-Norms**\n\n*   **Focus on Fractional Lp quasi-norms (0 < p < 1):** The paper itself highlights a trend of exploring adversarial robustness beyond the typical  \u21130, \u21131, \u21132, and \u2113\u221e norms.  It specifically addresses the gap in research concerning fractional  \u2113p \"norms\" (quasi-norms). This indicates a trend toward investigating less conventional, but potentially relevant, threat models.\n*   **Motivation for fractional Lp:** The authors explicitly state that fractional Lp threat models can be viewed as \"soft\" versions of \u21130 attacks, allowing attackers to subtly impact many pixels. They also cite Wang et al. (2021) who mention that their algorithm for  \u2113p-constrained optimization with p < 1 could be used to generate adversarial examples, motivating the need for defenses.\n*   **Limitations of Standard norms:** The Conclusion explicitly points out that the widely studied \u21132 norm is an open problem.\n\n**Trend: Deterministic (Provable) Robustness Guarantees**\n\n*   **Emphasis on Provable/Certified Robustness:**  The paper focuses on *provable* (certified) robustness, where each classification comes with a guarantee of correct classification within a certain radius. This is a significant trend, aiming for more reliable defenses than empirical robustness.\n*   **ImageNet Scale Deterministic Certification:** The paper positions itself within the trend of developing certifiably robust classifiers, with a focus on ImageNet scale.  It points out that \"randomized smoothing approaches... have shown to be uniquely promising for large-scale tasks...in the scale of ImageNet.\" However, these are *probabilistic*. The work by Levine and Feizi (2021) is cited as the only ImageNet-scale *deterministic* certification result for \u2113p norms before this paper.  The current paper extends Levine and Feizi (2021)'s work. This emphasizes a trend *toward* deterministic guarantees at scale.\n*   **Derandomization:** The inclusion of Section 5 on \"Quantization and Derandomization\" shows a clear trend towards removing the probabilistic nature of many defenses to get a firm guarantee. They aim to derandomize their algorithm \"to ensure an exact, rather than high-probability, guarantee.\"\n\n**Building on Randomized Smoothing, but Addressing its Limitations**\n\n*   **Randomized Smoothing as a Starting Point:** The paper acknowledges the success of randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020) for large-scale image classification.\n*   **Deterministic Smoothing:** The paper proposes a \"deterministic smoothing method\" that is an alternative to traditional randomized smoothing.  The key is that it provides *deterministic* Lipschitzness, contrasting with the *probabilistic* certificates from standard randomized smoothing.\n*   **Addressing limitations of randomized Smoothing:** They explicitly mention the drawbacks of randomized smoothing: \"they provide only probabilistic, rather than deterministic, certificate results, and rely on Monte-Carlo sampling at test time, requiring a large number of evaluations of the 'base classifier' neural network.\"  The proposed method aims to overcome these limitations. The authors also acknowledge the environmental impact of the sampling required for randomized smoothing.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Algorithms Mentioned (within the last 2 years, mostly building on older techniques):**\n\n*   **Variable-\u039b Smoothing (Proposed in this Paper):**  The core of the paper is a novel \"Variable-\u039b smoothing\" technique.  This involves allowing the smoothing parameter \u039b to vary randomly in each dimension.\n*   **Deterministic Smoothing with Lipschitz Continuity:** Key aspect is ensuring Lipschitz continuity of a function to a family of metrics.\n*   **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for Derandomization:** Used to design the distribution of the smoothing parameter \u039b to ensure deterministic guarantees.\n*   **Stability Training:** Mentioned as a method for training to improve robustness. (Li et al., 2019b).\n*   **Norm Inequalities for Certificate Conversion:** Used as a baseline, demonstrating that direct defenses are superior.\n*   **(de) randomized Smoothing:** Mentioned in Levine and Feizi (2020c).\n*   **Skew orthogonal convolutions:** Mentioned in Singla and Feizi (2021).\n*   **Orthogonalizing convolutional layers with the cayley transform:** Mentioned in Trockman and Kolter (2021).\n\n**Limitations Addressed and Future Directions (Indirect Trend Indicators):**\n\n*   **Quantized Input Domains:**  The technique is limited to \"bounded, quantized input domains,\" such as images. This is framed as not a significant limitation, as image classification is a primary domain.\n*   **\u2113p, p > 1 Attacks:** The conclusion states the technique does not directly apply to \u2113p, p > 1 attacks and that deterministic certification at ImageNet scale for these attacks is an \"open problem.\" This suggest a future research direction.\n*   **Narrow Threat Model:** The authors are careful to acknowledge their defense provides provable robustness only to a narrow threat model.\n*   **Patch Attacks:** (de) randomized Smoothing for certifiable defense against patch attacks in Levine and Feizi (2020c).\n\n**Key papers from the last 2 years (relevant to the research question):**\n\n*   **Levine and Feizi (2021):**  \"Improved, deterministic smoothing for l1 certified robustness.\"  This is the *foundation* upon which this paper builds. The technique is extended from  \u21131 to fractional  \u2113p norms.\n*   **Singla and Feizi (2021):** Skew orthogonal convolutions.\n*   **Trockman and Kolter (2021):** Orthogonalizing convolutional layers with the cayley transform.\n*   **Wang et al. (2021):** \"A hybrid first-order method for nonconvex \u2113p-ball constrained optimization.\" Relevant because it suggests a method for *generating* fractional Lp adversarial examples.\n*   **Levine and Feizi (2020a):** Robustness certificates for sparse adversarial attacks by randomized ablation.\n*   **Levine and Feizi (2020b):** Deep partition aggregation: Provable defenses against general poisoning attacks.\n*   **Levine and Feizi (2020c):** (de) randomized smoothing for certifiable defense against patch attacks.\n*   **Chachlakis and Markopoulos (2021):** Novel algorithms for lp-quasi-norm principal-component analysis.\n\n**In summary, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years, as evidenced by this paper, are:**\n\n1.  **Exploring Beyond Standard Lp Norms:**  Moving beyond the typical  \u21130, \u21131, \u21132, and  \u2113\u221e norms to investigate fractional  \u2113p quasi-norms.\n2.  **Focus on Deterministic (Provable) Robustness:**  Seeking *guaranteed* robustness rather than just empirical resistance.\n3.  **ImageNet Scaling of Deterministic Defenses:** Developing techniques that provide deterministic guarantees on large-scale datasets like ImageNet.\n4.  **Building on and Improving Randomized Smoothing:** Using randomized smoothing as inspiration but aiming for deterministic alternatives that overcome the limitations of probabilistic guarantees and high computational cost.\n5.  **Specific algorithmic improvements and methods**."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper and extract the information relevant to your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Automated Robustness with Adversarial Training as a Post-Processing Step\n\n**Key Takeaways and Relevance:**\n\nThis paper addresses a significant trend in adversarial robustness: **automating the creation of robust models and improving the efficiency of adversarial training.**  It specifically focuses on making adversarial training more practical and less computationally expensive.  Here's a detailed breakdown of how it relates to your question:\n\n*   **Trend: Automation of Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n    *   The paper directly tackles the problem of automating the generation of adversarially robust models.  This is a key trend because manual tuning of adversarial training is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge.\n    *   The approach uses Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find optimal network architectures *first*, then applies adversarial training as a *post-processing step*.  This is designed to be more efficient than incorporating robustness as a search criterion within NAS itself.\n\n*   **Trend: Efficient Adversarial Training:**\n\n    *   The paper introduces \"Hardening As Post-processing Step (HAPS),\" an algorithm designed to efficiently harden models against adversarial attacks.\n    *   HAPS uses an annealing schedule for key hyperparameters (attack budget, fraction of adversarial images) during adversarial training. This makes the process more stable and generalizable across datasets.\n    *   The authors specifically address the sensitivity of adversarial training to hyperparameters, making the automation process very difficult.\n\n*   **Image Classification Focus:**\n\n    *   The paper evaluates its approach on 11 image classification tasks (F-MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, GTSRB, STL10, SVHN, Flowers5, Flowers102, Quickdraw, Caltech256, Food101), demonstrating its effectiveness in this domain.\n\n*   **Key Techniques and Methodologies:**\n\n    *   **Neural Architecture Search (NAS):**  Uses NCEvolve (Neuro-Cell-based Evolutionary Search) to find an optimal architecture. This is followed by adversarial training.\n    *   **Adversarial Training:**  Uses Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to generate adversarial examples during training.\n    *   **Hyperparameter Annealing:**  Key to HAPS.  The attack budget (epsilon) and the fraction of adversarial examples in each mini-batch are gradually increased during training. This increases training stability.\n    *   **Robustness Evaluation:** Measures robustness using accuracy under PGD attacks (l-infinity norm).\n\n*   **Performance and Results:**\n\n    *   The authors claim that HAPS achieves comparable adversarial robustness to other methods but with significantly less computation time.  They specifically compare against methods that include robustness as part of the NAS search.\n    *   The paper shows that on some datasets, adversarial training even improves accuracy on benign (non-adversarial) examples, which is a valuable finding.\n\n*   **Limitations/Future Directions:**\n\n    *   The paper acknowledges that certain datasets (Food101, Flowers102) were challenging, and HAPS didn't result in significant robustness improvements. This suggests the approach may be sensitive to the characteristics of the dataset.\n    *   Future directions include:\n        *   Optimizing the model hardening pipeline further.\n        *   Extending the pipeline to broader threat models (beyond l-infinity).\n        *   Exploring the influence of different NAS approaches.\n\n**Specific Details/Algorithms:**\n\n*   **HAPS Algorithm:**  Algorithm 1 provides a pseudocode description of the Hardening As Post-processing Step.\n*   **PGD Attack:**  The Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack is used to generate adversarial examples.

It analyzes how architectural design choices affect robustness, which is relevant to the research question. The paper was published within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on information from the last 2 years (considering the paper was likely written in 2022 or 2023, making the relevant period 2021-2023):\n\n**I. Focus on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for Robustness:**\n\n*   **Growing Interest:** The paper highlights a rising trend of combining NAS with the objective of finding architectures that are robust against adversarial attacks and corruptions. This suggests a shift from solely optimizing for clean accuracy to incorporating robustness as a key design criterion.\n*   **Dataset Creation for NAS and Robustness:** A significant trend is the development and use of datasets specifically designed for benchmarking NAS algorithms in terms of robustness. This paper introduces one such dataset based on evaluations of the NAS-Bench-201 search space. This enables the research community to streamline research on architectural design choices and their impact on robustness.\n*   **Evaluation of Existing Architectures:**  There's a trend of evaluating the robustness of architectures found by existing NAS methods. The paper cites Devaguptapu et al. (2021) as an example, where the robustness of architectures found by methods like DARTS is investigated against various adversarial attacks.\n*   **Direct Search for Robust Architectures:** Researchers are now directly searching for robust architectures using one-shot NAS techniques. Guo et al. (2020) are mentioned as discovering a family of robust architectures through this approach.\n*   **Constraining Architectures for Robustness:**  Another trend involves constraining architectural parameters within a supernet to reduce the Lipschitz constant, aiming to increase the resulting networks' robustness (Dong et al., 2020a).\n*   **Differentiable Robust NAS:** A new line of research involves differentiable robust NAS, where differentiable network measurements are included in the one-shot loss target to increase robustness (Hosseini et al., 2021; Mok et al., 2021).\n\n**II. Methods for Improving Robustness via NAS:**\n\n*   **Jacobian Regularization:** Hosseini et al. (2021) use Jacobian-based differentiable metrics to measure robustness, suggesting the use of Jacobian regularization techniques to improve adversarial robustness. They define differentiable metrics like certified lower bound and Jacobian norm bound and search for architectures by maximizing these metrics.\n*   **Loss Landscape Smoothness:** Mok et al. (2021) propose a search algorithm that leverages the intrinsic robustness of a neural network, represented by the smoothness of the network's input loss landscape (Hessian matrix), for improving adversarial robustness.\n\n**III. Benchmarking and Analysis:**\n\n*   **RobustBench:** Croce et al. (2021) introduced RobustBench, a standardized adversarial robustness benchmark for tracking state-of-the-art models. This facilitates a more structured and comparable evaluation of robustness.\n*   **Importance of Architecture Design:** The paper emphasizes that a model's robustness against corruptions and adversarial attacks is highly sensitive to the architectural design. Careful architecture design can substantially improve robustness, potentially doubling it for networks with the same parameter count.\n*   **Analysis of Architectural Choices:** The paper includes an initial analysis of how architectural design choices affect robustness. For example, stacking convolution operations might improve robustness when designing architectures.\n*   **Training-Free Robustness Measurements:** Training-free robustness measurements, such as the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix and the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix, are evaluated. The paper benchmarks these measurements for their robustness predictability.\n\n**IV. Attacks and Defenses:**\n\n*   **Evaluation Against Diverse Attacks:** There's a move toward evaluating robustness against an ensemble of diverse attacks, including adaptive PGD (APGD) and blackbox attacks like Square Attack (Croce & Hein, 2020; Andriushchenko et al., 2020). This ensures a more comprehensive robustness assessment.\n\n**V. Key Findings from the Paper's Dataset:**\n\n*   **Architectural Influence:**  The accuracy boxplots (Figures 2 and 4) show growing gaps between mean and max accuracies, indicating that architecture has a significant impact on robust performance.\n*   **Distinctions in Attack Susceptibility:** Figure 3 reveals that there appear to be architectural distinctions for susceptibility to different attacks.\n*   **Sensitivity to Corruptions:**  Figure 5 shows that ranking architectures based on accuracy on different kinds of corruptions is mostly uncorrelated. This indicates a high diversity of sensitivity to different kinds of corruption based on architectural design.\n*   **Training-Free Measurement Limitations:**  The Jacobian- and Hessian-based measurements correlate well for smaller perturbation values, but not as well for larger perturbations.\n*   **NAS on Robustness Effectiveness:** Performing NAS directly on robust accuracy (e.g., FGSM) can improve overall robustness to different adversarial attacks (Table 1).\n*   **Topology Matters:** Carefully crafting network topology can have a substantial impact on robustness.\n*   **Parameter Count Matters:** Networks with large parameter counts are more robust in general, particularly against common corruptions.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe latest trends involve actively incorporating robustness into the neural architecture search process. This includes creating datasets for benchmarking robustness, developing new NAS algorithms that consider robustness metrics, and analyzing the impact of architectural choices on adversarial vulnerability. Jacobian and Hessian based measurements are being investigated as training-free ways to quickly evaluate robustness."

The paper was published within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided research paper and extracted the information most relevant to your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Trend:**\n\nThe paper highlights a trend toward using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find lightweight neural network architectures that are robust to adversarial attacks.  The core idea is that a smaller, more robust architecture can be found within a larger, non-robust \"teacher\" network.  This involves Network-to-Network (N2N) compression to improve adversarial robustness.  The paper positions itself by arguing that previous heuristic approaches to N2N compression are not adaptable enough to various attack scenarios and teacher network capacities, leading to suboptimal performance.\n\n**Details from the Paper (Published KDD '24):**\n\n1.  **Reinforced Compressive Neural Architecture Search (RC-NAS):** This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, RC-NAS, to address the limitations of existing approaches. RC-NAS adaptively compresses a \"teacher\" network to create a lightweight, adversarially robust \"student\" network. This is achieved through a dual-level training paradigm.\n2.  **Dual-Level Training Paradigm:**\n    *   **Meta-Training:** The RL agent is exposed to a diverse range of datasets, adversarial attacks, and teacher network configurations.  This aims to enable the agent to learn generalizable strategies for adversarial robustness. This meta-training phase typically takes around 45 hours.\n    *   **Fine-Tuning:**  The meta-trained RL agent is then fine-tuned on a specific target task (dataset and attack) to quickly adapt the architecture for optimal performance in that scenario. The fine-tuning stage usually requires 10 iterations and 3-9 hours to converge.\n3.  **RL State and Actions:**\n    *   **State:** The RL state encodes information about the teacher network topology (width, depth, stride, presence of robust blocks), the level of adversarial attack (estimated using the Lipschitz coefficient), dataset complexity, and computational budget.\n    *   **Action:** The RL agent's actions involve compressing the network at both the \"stage\" level (width and depth reduction) and the \"block\" level (convolution type, activation, normalization). It adaptively determines compression ratios for each stage based on the RL state.\n4.  **Reward Function:** The RL agent is trained to maximize a reward function that combines adversarial accuracy, compression ratio, and adherence to the computational budget.  There's an annealing penalty for exceeding the budget.\n5.  **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the RL-guided compression leads to better adversarial accuracy by reducing dense mixture components in the network. This suggests that the compression process helps to eliminate non-robust features.\n6.  **Experimental Results:** The RC-NAS framework is evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, using different teacher networks (WRN-28-10, WRN-34-12, WRN-46-14, WRN-70-16) and various adversarial attacks (PGD, CW, AutoAttack, and other SoTA attack methods like Boundary attack, Neuron-based attack, A3).  The results consistently show that RC-NAS achieves superior adversarial robustness and a better trade-off between accuracy and compression compared to baselines, including RobNet-large-v2, AdvRush, RACL, WRN-34-R, and RobustResNet A1-A4.\n\n**Key Takeaways Regarding Trends:**\n\n*   **NAS for Robustness is Maturing:**  The paper builds upon previous work in NAS for adversarial robustness, indicating that it's an active area of research.\n*   **Adaptive Compression:** The trend is shifting toward more adaptive methods that can tailor network architectures to specific attack scenarios rather than relying on fixed heuristics. This paper contributes to this trend by using RL to perform adaptive N2N compression.\n*   **Emphasis on Lightweight Models:**  The focus is on finding robust architectures that are also computationally efficient, suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n*   **RL as a Tool:** Reinforcement learning is emerging as a powerful tool for navigating the complex search space of network architectures and optimizing for multiple objectives (accuracy, robustness, and efficiency).\n*   **Theoretical Understanding:** There's a growing effort to provide theoretical explanations for why certain architectures are more robust than others.\n*   **Benchmarking Against Strong Attacks:** Evaluation is being done against more comprehensive and adaptive attacks like AutoAttack and other SoTA attacks.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations**\n\n*   While the paper presents strong results, it's important to consider that it is a single study.  Further research and independent validation are needed to confirm the generalizability of the RC-NAS framework.\n*   The 45 hour meta-training is relatively expensive.\n*   The reliance on the Lipschitz coefficient as an indicator of attack strength might be a point of weakness, as this measure could be manipulated by an adversary.\n\nIn summary, this paper indicates that a significant trend in adversarial robustness is the use of RL-driven NAS to create lightweight, adaptive, and theoretically sound architectures that are resilient to a diverse range of attacks."

      "summary": "Okay, I will extract the information from the provided paper that is relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Unlabeled Data Improves Adversarial Robustness\n\n**Authors:** Yair Carmon, Aditi Raghunathan, Ludwig Schmidt, Percy Liang, John C. Duchi\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on improving adversarial robustness using semi-supervised learning, specifically self-training, and leveraging unlabeled data. The central argument is that unlabeled data can bridge the sample complexity gap between standard and robust classification.\n\n**Trends and Techniques:**\n\n*   **Semi-Supervised Learning for Robustness:** The core trend is the use of semi-supervised learning techniques, particularly self-training, to enhance adversarial robustness. This approach leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to train more robust classifiers.\n\n*   **Robust Self-Training (RST):** The authors propose and evaluate a method called Robust Self-Training (RST). This involves:\n    *   Training an initial model on labeled data.\n    *   Using this model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data.\n    *   Retraining a robust model on the combined labeled data and pseudo-labeled data, using adversarial training or stability training.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training (Heuristic Robustness):**\n    *   The paper uses adversarial training as a method for achieving heuristic `l_infinity` robustness. Adversarial training involves augmenting the training data with adversarial examples (perturbed inputs designed to fool the classifier).\n    *   The authors use the Projected Gradient Method (PG) to generate adversarial examples. They also evaluate against the Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack.\n    *   The attacks are tuned to maximally reduce the accuracy of their model, highlighting a trend of adaptive attacks. They fine-tune the step size and number of restarts of the PG method.\n\n*   **Certified Robustness via Randomized Smoothing (Certified `l_2` and `l_infinity` Robustness):**\n    *   The paper explores certified robustness using randomized smoothing. This involves adding random noise to the input and training the model to be robust to these noisy inputs.\n    *   The method achieves certified `l_2` robustness and, through norm bounds, also achieves certified `l_infinity` robustness.\n    *   Stability training is used as the training objective to achieve certified `l_2` robustness using randomized smoothing.\n\n*   **Unlabeled Data Sources:** The paper uses two datasets to explore their method:\n    *   CIFAR-10, augmented with unlabeled images from 80 Million Tiny Images dataset.  A selection model is used to filter relevant images from the 80M Tiny Images.\n    *   SVHN, where the dataset's extra training set is used as unlabeled data by removing the labels.\n\n**Key Results:**\n\n*   **CIFAR-10:** RST achieves state-of-the-art heuristic `l_infinity` robustness against strong iterative attacks and improves certified `l_2` robustness via randomized smoothing. The standard accuracy of the model is also improved with RST.\n*   **SVHN:** RST improves robustness by using the dataset's extra training data (with labels removed).\n\n**Baselines and Comparisons:**\n\n*   The paper compares RST against standard adversarial training, virtual adversarial training (VAT), and other state-of-the-art robust classification methods like TRADES and PGMadry.\n*   The paper compares against standard self-training without robust training in the second step, and shows that it doesn't provide robustness.\n*   They perform ablation studies including data augmentation (Cutout and AutoAugment), varying the amount of labeled and unlabeled data.\n\n**Theoretical Analysis:**\n\n*   The paper provides theoretical results in a simplified Gaussian model, demonstrating that unlabeled data can bridge the sample complexity gap between standard and robust classification.\n\n**Related Work:**\n\n*   The paper discusses related work in semi-supervised learning, self-training for domain adaptation, training robust classifiers, sample complexity upper bounds, and barriers to robustness.\n*   It references several recent papers on adversarial robustness, adversarial training, and certified robustness (see the references section).\n\n**Reproducibility:**\n\n*   Code and data are available on GitHub and CodaLab.\n\n**In summary,** the paper highlights the trend of using semi-supervised learning, specifically self-training, and unlabeled data to significantly improve adversarial robustness in image classification. It combines heuristic defenses (adversarial training) with certified defenses (randomized smoothing) and provides both empirical results and theoretical analysis to support its claims. It introduces robust self-training(RST), a new method that trains first an intermediate model on labeled data and then a robust model with labeled and unlabeled data (pseudo-labeled using the intermediate model) via adversarial training or stability training. It shows an improvement over the state-of-the-art in both heuristic and certified robustness."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focusing on Trends in the Last 2 Years (Approx. 2022-2024, given the paper's publication date):**\n\nThe paper focuses on **certified defenses in the black-box setting** using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization techniques.  This is a key trend.  Specifically, the paper addresses the limitations of prior ZO-based defense methods and proposes improvements.\n\n**Key Trends and Techniques Discussed/Employed:**\n\n1.  **Zeroth-Order (ZO) Optimization for Black-Box Defense:** This is a central theme.  ZO optimization is used when gradients of the target model are unavailable (black-box setting). The paper highlights that ZO optimization methods are increasingly being applied to both attack and defense in scenarios where model internals are hidden.  It describes two ZO techniques:\n    *   **Randomized Gradient Estimate (RGE):** Used in their proposed ZO-RUDS defense.\n    *   **Coordinate-wise Gradient Estimation (CGE):** Used in their proposed ZO-AE-RUDS defense.\n\n2.  **Certified Robustness:** The paper's core is about *certified* robustness, meaning providing formal guarantees about the model's prediction within a certain neighborhood of the input. This contrasts with *empirical* defenses, which may be effective but lack formal guarantees.  The paper builds upon the idea of **Randomized Smoothing (RS)**.\n\n3.  **Denoised Smoothing (DS):** A technique where a denoiser is prepended to the classifier to remove adversarial perturbations before they reach the classifier. This improves robustness. The paper cites Salman et al. [26] as a key prior work in this area.\n\n4.  **UNet-based Denoisers:** A significant contribution of the paper is the introduction of a robust UNet denoiser (RDUNet).  The paper argues that previous denoisers used in ZO-based defenses were not effective for high-dimensional datasets, leading to high model variance. The UNet architecture, with its skip connections and upsampling/downsampling layers, is better at preserving spatial information and learning fine-scale details, making it suitable for high-dimensional images.  The paper also contrasts RDUNet with other denoisers, including MemNet, DnCNN, and Diffusion models.\n\n5.  **Autoencoders (AEs):** The paper explores the use of autoencoders in conjunction with denoisers (in their ZO-AE-RUDS method). The AE is used to reduce the dimensionality of the input, which can make ZO optimization more feasible, especially when using CGE.  However, the paper acknowledges that AEs can lead to information loss if not designed carefully, hence the need for a robust denoiser *before* the AE.\n\n6.  **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD):** The paper uses MMD as a loss term in its objective function to bring the distribution of denoised images closer to the distribution of clean images. This helps to improve the quality of the denoised images and, consequently, the robustness of the defense.  This distribution matching approach is inspired by domain adaptation techniques.\n\n**Specific Methods Proposed in the Paper:**\n\n*   **ZO-RUDS (ZO Robust UNet Denoised Smoothing):** Prepending the RDUNet denoiser to the black-box classifier and training the denoiser using ZO optimization (specifically RGE).\n*   **ZO-AE-RUDS (ZO Autoencoder-based Robust UNet Denoised Smoothing):** Prepending the RDUNet denoiser *and* an autoencoder to the black-box classifier and training the denoiser and autoencoder using ZO optimization (specifically CGE).\n\n**Limitations of Prior Work Addressed:**\n\n*   **High Model Variance with ZO Optimization:** The paper argues that directly applying ZO optimization to denoisers, as done in prior work, leads to high model variance, especially for high-dimensional datasets. Their RDUNet is designed to mitigate this.\n*   **Ineffective Denoisers:** The paper claims that previous denoisers are not as effective at preserving spatial information and fine-scale details, limiting their performance on high-dimensional data.\n*   **Limited Utilization of ZO Techniques:**  The paper points out that some prior work could only use specific ZO optimization techniques (CGE) due to limitations in their architecture.\n\n**Evaluation Metrics Used:**\n\n*   **Standard Certified Accuracy (SCA):** The percentage of correctly classified samples that have a certified radius greater than 0.\n*   **Robust Certified Accuracy (RCA):**  The percentage of correctly classified samples that have a certified radius greater than a specified value (e.g., 0.25, 0.50, 0.75).\n\n**Summary of Key Ideas Related to Recent Trends:**\n\n*   Certified defenses remain a very active area of research.\n*   Black-box defenses are increasingly important for practical applications, given privacy concerns and the difficulty of accessing model internals.\n*   ZO optimization provides a means to train defenses in the black-box setting.\n*   Careful design of denoisers is crucial for the success of denoised smoothing defenses, especially in the black-box setting.  UNet architectures are a promising direction.\n*   Combining denoisers with autoencoders can be beneficial for high-dimensional data, but it requires careful consideration to avoid information loss.\n*   Loss functions that promote both feature similarity and domain similarity between clean and denoised images can improve robustness.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper indicates a trend towards more sophisticated denoiser architectures (like UNets) and a focus on certified robustness in black-box settings, addressing the limitations of directly applying ZO optimization with simpler denoisers.  The use of MMD loss to match distributions is also a noteworthy technique."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the most relevant information from the paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Key Findings & Contributions of the Paper (ROCLIP)**\n\n*   **Focus:** This paper addresses adversarial robustness in the *pre-training* phase of vision-language models, specifically CLIP, against targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks. This is important because traditional adversarial robustness research often focuses on fine-tuning or inference stages.\n\n*   **Problem:** Vision-language models like CLIP are *extremely vulnerable* to data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to the massive, often uncurated datasets they are trained on. Even a tiny fraction of poisoned data (0.0001% for targeted poisoning, 0.01% for backdoors) can be effective. Larger models are *more* vulnerable.\n\n*   **ROCLIP Solution:**  The paper proposes a novel method called ROCLIP (Robust CLIP) to defend against these attacks during *pre-training*. ROCLIP's core idea is to break the association between poisoned image-caption pairs early in training. It does this through:\n\n    *   **Caption Pool:** Maintaining a large, varying pool of random captions. Instead of matching an image to its original caption, ROCLIP matches it to the *most similar* caption *within the pool*. This disrupts the intended association of poisoned image-caption pairs.\n    *   **Data Augmentation:** Applying both image and text augmentations to further strengthen the defense and improve performance.\n\n*   **Results:**  ROCLIP is shown to be highly effective:\n\n    *   Reduces targeted data poisoning attack success rates from 93.75% to 12.5%.\n    *   Eliminates backdoor attack success (down to 0%).\n    *   *Improves* linear probe performance by up to 10% compared to standard CLIP pre-training.\n    *   Maintains similar zero-shot performance.\n    *   ROCLIP can defend against strong attacks, which add up to 1% poisoned examples to the data, and successfully maintain a low attack success rate of 12.5%, while trading off the performance on some tasks.\n\n**How this Relates to Trends in Adversarial Robustness (Specifically in the context of the research question):**\n\n1.  **Shifting Focus to Pre-training:** The paper highlights a trend of recognizing the *importance of robustness during pre-training*.  Most prior work addresses robustness in downstream tasks, assuming the pre-trained model is clean. This paper demonstrates that vulnerabilities can be introduced *during* pre-training, which is often overlooked.\n\n2.  **Contrastive Learning Vulnerabilities:** The paper addresses vulnerabilities specific to *contrastive learning* methods used in vision-language models. The core mechanism of contrastive learning \u2013 pulling related representations together \u2013 can be exploited by adversaries who inject carefully crafted poisoned pairs.\n\n3.  **Data Augmentation as Defense:** The use of data augmentation is a common trend in adversarial robustness. This paper confirms its effectiveness in the multimodal setting, particularly in conjunction with other defense mechanisms.\n\n4.  **Defense against Backdoor Attacks:** The paper showcases the ability to defend against backdoor attacks, a specific type of adversarial attack that has gained significant attention in recent years. Defending against backdoors requires different strategies than defending against general adversarial examples.\n\n**Details on the Attacks Considered:**\n\n*   **Targeted Image Attacks:** The goal is to make the model misclassify a specific test image as a pre-defined \"adversarial\" label. This is achieved by adding poisoned examples where the target image is paired with captions related to the adversarial label.\n*   **Backdoor Attacks:** A small \"trigger\" patch is overlaid on a subset of training images, which are then paired with adversarial captions. The goal is that *any* image with the trigger will be misclassified as the adversarial label.\n\n**Related Work (Relevant to the \"Latest Trends\" part of the Research Question):**\n\nThe paper cites and contrasts its approach with other recent work:\n\n*   **Carlini & Terzis (2021):** Demonstrates the vulnerability of contrastive learning to poisoning and backdoor attacks. This work is a key motivator for the ROCLIP paper.\n*   **Yang et al. (2022):** Focuses on *poison identification during fine-tuning* of CLIP. This work is not applicable to the pre-training setting, as confirmed in the paper's experiments. The paper defends against targeted data poisoning attacks during fine-tuning using pre-processing and post-processing defenses.\n*   **Bansal et al. (2023):** Proposes CleanCLIP to *eliminate backdoor effects from a pre-trained CLIP model* by fine-tuning on a clean dataset. This approach is also shown to be ineffective for pre-training defense. CleanCLIP mitigates data poisoning attacks in multimodal contrastive learning by fine-tuning on a clean subset of the pre-training data with in-modality contrastive loss on both vision and language modalities.\n*   **Other Cited Works:** The paper also references various works on contrastive learning, data augmentation, and specific attack methods, which provide context for the broader landscape of research in this area.\n*   **General Trends from Related Work:**\n    *   *Contrastive learning is becoming increasingly popular, but also a target for adversarial attacks.*\n    *   *Fine-tuning based defenses are not always effective for pre-training vulnerabilities.*\n    *   *There's growing interest in \"clean label\" backdoor attacks, which are more difficult to detect.*\n\n**Limitations & Future Work (Indicating future trends):**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that ROCLIP involves a performance trade-off when defending against very strong attacks.\n*   Future work should focus on developing stronger defense methods *without* significant performance loss.\n\n**In summary,** this paper highlights a crucial emerging trend: addressing adversarial robustness in the *pre-training* of large vision-language models, with a specific focus on the vulnerabilities introduced by contrastive learning and the need for defenses tailored to this setting. The use of caption pools and data augmentation demonstrates how existing techniques can be adapted and combined to provide effective protection."

This reflects a *trend* in the adversarial robustness community towards more rigorous evaluation methodologies, recognizing that defenses must be robust to attackers who are aware of the defense.\n*   **Transferability of Defenses:** Evaluating the transferability of AADN to different tracker architectures is important.\n*   **Efficiency:** It is also important for the defense to have excellent processing efficiency, which is 5ms /frame in this paper.\n\n**Specific Details Extracted (with focus on recent trends):**\n\n1.  **Problem Addressed:** Lack of adversarial defense methods specifically designed for object tracking. Existing image classification defenses don't transfer well.\n2.  **Proposed Solution:** Auxiliary Adversarial Defense Network (AADN), based on U-Net. Designed to be a plug-and-play module.\n3.  **Defense Strategy:** Dua-Loss guided adversarial training. The Dua-Loss combines fore-background classification loss and regression loss. The adversarial training explores adversarial samples based on gradient information.\n4.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Used OTB100, VOT2018, and LaSOT datasets. Evaluated against non-adaptive (white-box CSA, DFA, and black-box IoU Attack) and adaptive attacks.\n5.  **Key Results:**\n\n    *   AADN demonstrates good robustness against adversarial attacks in both adaptive and non-adaptive attack scenarios.\n    *   AADN exhibits defense transferability, enabling seamless integration with existing trackers without retraining.\n    *   AADN has excellent processing efficiency (5ms/frame).\n6.  **Ablation Studies:** Showed the effectiveness of Dua-Loss compared to using only classification loss or regression loss.\n\n**Cited Papers (Potentially Relevant, Check Dates):**\n\nThe paper references several papers which could be useful in identifying latest trends, if they fall within the last 2 years:\n\n*   \\[2] Adversarial training\n*   \\[4] C&W attack\n*   \\[5] One-Shot Attack\n*   \\[7] Adversarial defense\n*   \\[9] Adversarial sample generation\n*   \\[10] SPARK\n*   \\[11] IoU Attack\n*   \\[13] BIM\n*   \\[15] SiamRPN\n*   \\[17] UTA\n*   \\[18] FAN\n*   \\[21] PGD-AT\n*   \\[22] Adversarial defense for image classification\n*   \\[25] Free-AT\n*   \\[26] DFA\n*   \\[27] Adversarial samples\n*   \\[28] Adaptive attacks\n*   \\[29] SiamMask\n*   \\[31] Fast-AT\n*   \\[33] CSA\n*   \\[34] OCEAN\n\n**Trends Indicated (based on paper and its approach):**\n\n*   **Task-Specific Defenses:** Moving beyond generic image classification defenses to create defenses tailored to the specific requirements and architectures of other vision tasks like object tracking.\n*   **Plug-and-Play Defense Modules:** Designing defense mechanisms as modular components that can be easily integrated into existing systems without extensive retraining.\n*   **Adaptive Attack Robustness:** A strong focus on evaluating defenses against adaptive attackers, forcing more robust defense strategies.\n*   **Loss Function Engineering:** Crafting custom loss functions for adversarial training to target specific vulnerabilities or characteristics of the model and task.\n*   **Efficiency as a First-Class Citizen:**  Considering computational efficiency as a key design constraint for defense mechanisms, ensuring they can be deployed in real-time systems.\n\n**Limitations based on the research question:**\n\n*   **Focus is Not Image Classification:** The primary focus is adversarial robustness in *object tracking*.

That task is left to the user.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper provides valuable insights into adversarial robustness, particularly in the context of object tracking. While it doesn't directly address image classification trends, the defense strategies (adversarial training, modular defenses, adaptive attack evaluation) are relevant and point to broader trends in the field. A deeper analysis of the cited papers, focusing on their publication dates and content, would be necessary to get a more complete picture of image classification-specific trends."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper to answer the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper (and its relevance to adversarial robustness trends):**\n\n*   **Defense against Adversarial Attacks:** This paper directly addresses the problem of adversarial robustness, aiming to develop a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks on image classifiers.\n*   **Threat Model Agnostic Defense:** A key focus is on creating a defense that is *not* specific to a particular type of adversarial attack (i.e., threat model agnostic). This is important because many existing defenses are effective only against the types of attacks they were trained on and fail to generalize.\n*   **Preprocessing-Based Approach:** The authors use a preprocessing step *before* the image is fed into the classifier to remove or weaken adversarial perturbations. This is a common trend, and this paper contributes a specific method to it.\n*   **Diffusion Models:** The core innovation is using diffusion models (a type of generative model) within the preprocessing step to denoise attacked images and project them onto the learned image manifold. This leverages recent advances in generative modeling for defense.\n\n**II. Specific Techniques and Contributions:**\n\n*   **Stochastic Diffusion-Based Preprocessing:** The paper introduces a novel method that adds Gaussian noise to the attacked image and then uses a pre-trained diffusion process (iterative denoising) to produce a high-quality denoised image. The stochasticity (noise injection at each step) is crucial for robustness.\n*   **Threat Model Agnosticism Validation:** The authors propose an evaluation method to assess threat model agnosticism:\n    *   Average accuracy over a wide range of attacks.\n    *   Average accuracy across *unseen* attacks (attacks the defense wasn't specifically trained to handle).\n*   **Algorithm 2 (Preprocessing Defense Method):** Describes the algorithm, which involves adding noise to the input image and then iteratively denoising it using the diffusion model.\n*  **Evaluation on CIFAR-10:** The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing it outperforms leading defense methods under various threat models (L\u221e, \u03f5 = 8/255), (L\u221e, \u03f5 = 16/255), (L2, \u03f5 = 1), (L2, \u03f5 = 2).\n*   **Comparison to ADP:** The paper compares its method to Adaptive Denoising Purification (ADP), another preprocessing-based defense, showing superior performance under grey-box, BPDA+EOT, and white-box attacks.\n*   **Analysis of Diffusion Depth (T\\*):** The paper highlights the importance of choosing the appropriate diffusion depth. Too shallow, and the perturbation isn't removed; too deep, and the semantic content of the image is lost.\n\n**III.  Trends in Adversarial Robustness (as reflected in the paper):**\n\n*   **Generalization to Unseen Attacks:** A major trend is moving *beyond* defenses that only work against specific, known attacks.  The paper directly addresses the \"poor generalization to unseen attacks\" problem, referencing \\[13, 2] to highlight this as an unsolved issue.  The paper's threat-model-agnostic approach aligns with this trend.\n*   **Preprocessing-Based Defenses:** Using a preprocessing step to \"clean\" adversarial examples before classification is a recognized trend. The paper cites several works in this area \\[36, 30, 42, 12, 7, 15, 43].\n*   **Generative Models for Defense:** Utilizing generative models (like diffusion models, GANs, or Energy-Based Models) for adversarial defense is a significant trend.  This paper explores this by projecting attacked images onto the learned image manifold.\n*  **Stochasticity in Defenses:** Incorporating stochasticity (randomness) into the defense mechanism is becoming more common to make attacks more difficult.  The paper's use of noise injection in the diffusion process reflects this.\n*   **Emphasis on Stronger Attack Evaluation:** The paper uses sophisticated attack methods like BPDA+EOT (Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation + Expectation Over Transformation) to evaluate the defense, indicating a trend toward more rigorous testing.  It also uses white-box attacks, assuming the attacker has full knowledge of the system.\n*  **Evaluation Metrics for Generalization:** The paper's use of \"Average of Unseen Attacks\" as an evaluation metric demonstrates the growing awareness of the need to measure how well defenses generalize.\n*   **Use of Diffusion Models:** The application of diffusion models is a relatively recent trend in generative modeling, and this paper explores their use in the context of adversarial defense.\n\n**IV. Key References (and what they indicate about trends):**\n\nThe references provide further insights into relevant trends. Here's a sampling:\n\n*   **\\[2] T. Bai, et al. (2021):** \"Recent advances in adversarial training for adversarial robustness.\"  This shows that adversarial training remains an active area of research, but the paper acknowledges its limitations in generalization.\n*   **\\[13] D. Hendrycks, et al. (2021):** \"Unsolved problems in ml safety.\"  This reference highlights the broader context of machine learning safety and the persistent challenges in adversarial robustness.\n*   **\\[16] J. Ho, et al. (2020):** \"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models.\"  This is a foundational paper on diffusion models, indicating the growing interest in these models.\n*   **\\[34] J. Song, et al. (2020):** \"Denoising diffusion implicit models.\" Another key paper regarding diffusion models\n*   **\\[43] J. Yoon, et al. (2021):** \"Adversarial purification with score-based generative models.\"  This is a direct competitor using a similar preprocessing approach with generative models, indicating a trend in that direction.\n\n**V. Limitations and Future Directions (Inferred):**\n\nWhile not explicitly stated, the paper's focus on threat model agnosticism suggests a limitation of many existing defenses.  Future research directions likely involve:\n\n*   Developing even more robust and generalizable defenses.\n*   Exploring different generative model architectures for defense.\n*   Creating more adaptive defenses that can respond to evolving attack strategies.\n*   Addressing the computational cost of defenses based on generative models (as highlighted in the supplementary material regarding diffusion steps).\n\nIn summary, this paper is highly relevant to the research question. It reflects the latest trends in adversarial robustness by focusing on threat-model-agnostic defenses, using generative models (specifically diffusion models) in a preprocessing-based approach, and emphasizing robust evaluation methods. The cited papers further corroborate these trends."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to address the research question:  \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**General Trend (based on the paper's Introduction):**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that adversarial training has been a prominent and effective approach for adversarial robustness.\n*   Image transformation-based defenses were explored earlier, but many have been broken by adaptive attacks.  This stream was declining, however the paper argues that such transformations are still worthy to explore.\n\n**Specific Technique Proposed and its Relevance to Current Trends:**\n\n*   **Error Diffusion Halftoning:** The paper proposes using error diffusion halftoning (specifically Floyd-Steinberg dithering) as a pre-processing image transformation for defense.  This is presented as a novel approach, claiming to be the first to leverage digital halftoning for adversarial defense.\n*   **Combination with Adversarial Training:** The authors *combine* their halftoning technique with adversarial training. This is crucial because it highlights a trend: defenses are often not standalone solutions but are used in conjunction with other techniques like adversarial training.\n*   **Focus on Adaptive Attacks:**  The paper emphasizes that their method is designed to resist *adaptive* attacks, where the attacker is aware of the defense mechanism. This is a key concern in adversarial robustness research \u2013 defenses must be robust to informed adversaries.\n*   **White-box setting:** The paper evaluates their method under the white-box setting where the attacker has complete knowledge of the defense\n*   **Balanced Approach:** The paper claims their method strikes a balance between adversarial robustness, clean data performance, and efficiency.\n\n**Key Claims and Contributions:**\n\n*   **Robustness against multiple attacks:** The method is effective against PGD-\u2113\u221e, PGD-\u21132, Mult-\u2113\u221e and Mult-\u21132 attacks.\n*   **Maintains Clean Data Performance:** Unlike some image transformation defenses that significantly degrade performance on clean (non-adversarial) images, the authors claim their halftoning approach preserves clean data accuracy.  In some cases, it can even improve clean data accuracy when combined with adversarial training.\n*   **Weakens Adaptive Attacks:** It is hypothesized that the error diffusion mechanism makes it harder for adaptive attacks to approximate gradients accurately.\n*   **Efficiency:** Floyd-Steinberg dithering is efficient (compared to more complex halftoning algorithms).\n\n**Experimental Details and Results:**\n\n*   **Dataset:** CIFAR-10\n*   **Network:** ResNet-18\n*   **Baselines:** Compared against Gaussian blur, non-local means, JPEG compression, and bit-depth reduction (all image transformation-based defenses).\n*   **Training:** Follows Madry's adversarial training protocol.\n*   **Adaptive Attack Evaluation:** Uses BPDA (Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation) to evaluate defenses against obfuscated gradients caused by JPEG compression, bit-depth reduction, and halftoning.\n*   **Results Highlighted:**\n    *   Halftoning + adversarial training significantly improves robustness against all four attacks compared to vanilla adversarial training.\n    *   Halftoning maintains better clean data accuracy compared to other defenses when used with adversarial training.\n\n**Limitations and Caveats (Implied, not explicitly stated):**\n\n*   The evaluation is primarily on CIFAR-10.  Generalization to more complex datasets (e.g., ImageNet) might require further investigation.\n*   The paper focuses on image transformation as a *defense* mechanism. It does not discuss or propose new *attack* methods.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper aligns with the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification:\n\n1.  **Adversarial Training as a Foundation:**  It builds *upon* adversarial training rather than trying to replace it.\n2.  **Focus on Adaptive Attacks:** It explicitly addresses the need for defenses to be robust against adaptive attacks.\n3.  **Image Transformations as a Complementary Defense:** Explores a specific image transformation (halftoning) not as a standalone solution but as a component in a broader defense strategy.\n4.  **Balancing Robustness and Clean Accuracy:**  Acknowledges and attempts to mitigate the common problem of defenses sacrificing accuracy on clean data.\n5.  **White-box evaluation:** Robustness is tested under the restrictive white-box setting"

      "relevancy": "This paper discusses defenses against adversarial backdoor attacks in image classification, which falls directly under the umbrella of adversarial robustness. Its focus on contributor-aware defenses offers a new perspective on mitigating adversarial threats.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper and focusing on the last 2 years (2022-2024), here's the relevant information concerning trends in adversarial robustness for image classification:\n\n**Overall Trend:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on **adversarial backdoor attacks** and proposes a novel defense mechanism. While not directly a trend in general adversarial robustness, the increasing attention to backdoor attacks *is* a relevant trend. Backdoor attacks are a specific type of vulnerability where a model performs well on clean data but misclassifies inputs when a specific trigger is present. The paper highlights the increasing sophistication and potential danger of such attacks.\n\n**Specifics from the Paper (and context to the research question):**\n\n1.  **Backdoor Attacks Remain a Concern:**  The paper implicitly acknowledges the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between adversarial attacks and defenses.  The fact that new defenses are constantly needed implies that existing robustness measures are often circumvented, and newer, more subtle attacks (like backdoor attacks) emerge.\n2.  **Limitations of Detection-Based Defenses:** The paper criticizes traditional defenses against backdoor attacks that focus on *detecting* and removing poisoned samples. It argues that these are often unreliable and can be bypassed by novel backdoor designs. This suggests a trend away from purely detection-based mechanisms, or at least a recognition of their limitations. The authors reference a paper ([11] E. Wenger, et al., CVPR 2021) showing that backdoor attacks can be effective in the physical world.\n3.  **Contributor-Aware Training:** The paper's main contribution is a \"contributor-aware\" defensive framework. This approach shifts the perspective:\n    *   It assumes the presence of multiple data contributors, some of whom might be adversarial.\n    *   It retains (potentially anonymized) metadata linking data instances to their contributors.\n    *   It uses semi-supervised ensembles and learning from crowds techniques to filter out false labels introduced by adversarial triggers.\n\n    The core idea is to build an ensemble of classifiers, each trained on data from a different contributor.  Even if some classifiers are compromised by backdoor attacks, the ensemble as a whole remains robust because the \"good\" classifiers can correct the misclassifications of the compromised ones. This strategy is presented as being agnostic to specific backdoor patterns.\n4.  **Emphasis on Realistic Threat Models:**  The authors argue that many existing adversarial robustness studies rely on unrealistic threat models (e.g., assuming the attacker has full control over the training process).  They advocate for more practical models where adversaries have limited access, such as contributing data to a shared database. This shift toward more realistic threat models is itself a trend, as it encourages the development of defenses that are more likely to be effective in real-world scenarios.\n5.  **Semi-Supervised Learning and Ensembles:** The paper's use of semi-supervised learning and ensemble methods points toward another potential trend. By leveraging unlabeled data and combining multiple models, these techniques can improve robustness without requiring perfect data sanitization.  Specifically, the use of:\n    *   **Semi-Supervised Learning:** To utilize data from different contributors, even if some labels are unreliable.\n    *   **Learning from Crowds:**  To aggregate predictions from multiple classifiers and filter out noisy labels (the outputs of classifiers that have been successfully backdoored).\n6.  **Specific Techniques and Algorithms:**  The paper mentions specific techniques used in their experiments, which, while not necessarily \"trends,\" are relevant methods in the field:\n    *   **PreAct ResNet 18:** As a baseline classifier.\n    *   **RandAugment:** For data augmentation.\n    *   **Auxiliary Deep Generative Models (ADGMs):**  Used in the MNIST experiments.\n    *   **FixMatch:** A semi-supervised learning algorithm used in the CIFAR-10 and GTSRB experiments.\n    *   **OpinionRank:**  An algorithm for learning from crowds (aggregating predictions).\n7.  **Datasets:** The paper utilizes standard benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB for evaluation, highlighting their continued relevance in the field. The authors mention deliberately avoiding experiments on facial recognition datasets due to ethical concerns, which also touches upon a relevant trend of ethical considerations in AI research.\n8. **Plug-and-play framework:** The authors define their method as a \"plug-and-play framework for secure learning\"\n\n**In summary, based on this paper, relevant trends in adversarial robustness for image classification include:**\n\n*   Increased focus on backdoor attacks as a significant threat.\n*   A move towards more realistic threat models.\n*   Exploration of semi-supervised learning and ensemble methods for robustness.\n*   Recognition of the limitations of purely detection-based defenses.\n* The creation of plug-and-play frameworks for secure learning.\n\nIt's important to remember that this is based on *one* paper. A comprehensive review of the literature would be necessary to identify definitive trends."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on analyzing adversarial examples by providing a framework to study adversary knowledge in image classification.\n*   While it surveys recent attacks, it's more of a \"Systematization of Knowledge\" (SoK) paper rather than a direct presentation of novel attacks or defenses.\n*   The paper's survey includes papers from the last two years.\n*   It aims to address the lack of emphasis on rigorous assessment of adversary knowledge in threat models.\n*   It formalizes adversary knowledge as a theoretical framework to model various adversarial example attacks.\n\n**Trends in Adversarial Robustness (based on surveyed papers):**\n\nBased on the surveyed papers published in 2022 and 2023, the following trends can be inferred:\n\n1.  ***Shift Towards More Realistic and Usable Attacks:***  The field is moving away from purely theoretical white-box attacks and towards more practical and realistic scenarios. This is evident in the emergence of:\n    *   **Unrestricted Adversarial Examples:** Attacks that don't have strict constraints on the magnitude or type of perturbation.\n    *   **Black-box and No-box (Transferable) Threat Models:**  Attacks that aim to transfer to models without requiring knowledge of the target model's architecture or parameters.\n\n2.  ***Importance of Adversary Knowledge and Threat Model Formalization:***  There is a growing recognition of the need to rigorously define and assess adversary knowledge in threat models. The paper itself is motivated by this trend.\n\n3.  ***Transferability Focus:***  A significant portion of recent research focuses on improving the transferability of adversarial examples. Many surveyed papers explore techniques to craft attacks that are effective against a range of different models.\n\n4.  ***Use of Additional Information in Transferable Attacks:***  Transferable attacks can achieve high ESRs when using information such as the training data or the training process (e.g., to train surrogate models).\n\n5.  ***Query-Based Attacks:***  Query-based access to a model is sufficient to render it useless if the model is undefended.\n\n6.  ***Defenses:*** Defended models perform better than undefended ones, however, the accuracy loss is still significant.\n\n**Key Findings and Implications:**\n\n*   **Transferable attacks are potent:**  Transferable attacks, when provided with additional information like training data and training functions, can achieve performance levels comparable to white-box attacks.\n*   **Information Categories Matter:** The impact of different categories of information (model, data, training, defense) on attack performance depends on the context. Data and training information become crucial in transferable settings.\n*   **Training information is understated:** Critical to transferable attacks.\n*   **Undefended models are easily broken:**  Confirming the well-known fact, undefended models remain highly vulnerable.\n*   **Need for Standard Evaluation:** Lack of standardization makes comparisons difficult.\n*   **Evaluation against defended models:**  There is a need for more evaluation against defended models.\n\n**Specific Attacks and Defenses Mentioned (as examples; not necessarily the most cutting-edge, as this is a SoK paper):**\n\n*   **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD):** A well-known attack used as an example to demonstrate the formalization.\n*   **Carlini-Wagner (CW) attack:** mentioned in the context of optimization-based adversarial example generation.\n*   **Adversarial Training:** Mentioned as one defense approach but noted as still failing to provide adequate protection.\n*   **Ensemble Approaches:** Similar to adversarial training, mentioned as defenses but also noted that they don't provide adequate protection.\n*   **Provably Robust Defenses:**  Mentioned but deemed impractical due to computational cost.\n\n**Details of the attack survey:**\n\n* The survey includes 83 papers.\n* The survey focuses on indistinguishable perturbation untargeted attacks on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets.\n\n**Table Summaries:**\n\nThe provided tables give an overview of the surveyed attacks with respect to the following criteria:\n\n*   **Model Information:** What the attacker knows about the model (parameters, architecture, query access).\n*   **Data Information:** What data the attacker has access to (training data, other data from the same or different distributions).\n*   **Training Information:** What the attacker knows about the training process.\n*   **Defense Information:** What the attacker knows about the defense mechanisms in place (none of the surveyed papers used any defense information).\n*   **Metric:** The metric used to craft the adversarial examples (L0, L2, L\u221e norms).\n\n**Papers Included in the evaluation:**\n\n*   LGV\n*   Pixle\n*   MASSA\n*   SSAH\n*   BIA\n*   ACG\n*   ATA\n*   AEG\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   The paper is primarily theoretical, focusing on formalization rather than a direct empirical investigation of the latest attacks.\n*   The specific attacks mentioned might not represent the absolute state-of-the-art due to the paper's broader scope.\n\n**In summary,** based on the survey presented in this paper, recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification involve a shift toward more realistic attacks (unrestricted, transferable), a growing emphasis on rigorously defining adversary knowledge, a focus on improving the transferability of attacks, and the use of more information in transferable settings.**"

      "summary": "Okay, I've reviewed the provided paper and extracted the relevant information to address your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the paper's contribution to that topic, keeping in mind the recency constraint (last 2 years):\n\n**Paper Focus:**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on **adversarial attacks against Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, *not* standard image classification models. While related, this is a crucial distinction. The paper explores how to craft adversarial images that can mislead VLMs into producing targeted, harmful content.\n\n**Key Contributions and Trends (within the last 2 years, focusing on image classification robustness where applicable):**\n\n1.  **Targeted Adversarial Attacks on VLMs:**\n\n    *   The core trend highlighted is the growing concern about the vulnerability of VLMs to image-based adversarial attacks.\n    *   The paper argues that *targeted* attacks are especially dangerous because they can force the VLM to generate specific, predetermined (often harmful) outputs, unlike untargeted attacks that simply cause errors.\n    *   This is relevant to image classification robustness because it extends the concept of adversarial examples to a more complex, multimodal setting. If a VLM's image encoder is susceptible, it can be manipulated, which has downstream consequences for the language generation component.\n\n2.  **Self-Supervised Attack Framework (AnyAttack):**\n\n    *   The paper introduces a novel framework called \"AnyAttack\" for generating targeted adversarial images for VLMs *without* relying on predefined target labels during training. This is a significant departure from earlier methods.\n    *   **Pre-training and Fine-tuning:** AnyAttack uses a \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm. A noise generator is pre-trained on a large dataset (LAION-400M) and then fine-tuned for specific downstream vision-language tasks. The authors claim this is the first time this paradigm has been used for targeted adversarial attacks at scale.\n         *   This pre-training approach is relevant to general adversarial robustness because it suggests that learning generalizable adversarial perturbations from large datasets can be effective.\n    *   **Self-Supervision via Image Itself:** AnyAttack uses the original image as a form of self-supervision. The goal is to create adversarial noise that, when added to a *different* image, will cause the VLM to interpret the result as similar to the original image.\n    *   **K-Augmentation:**  To improve generalization and efficiency, AnyAttack uses K-augmentation. This involves creating multiple shuffled versions of the original images within each mini-batch during training.\n    *   **Auxiliary Models:** The use of auxiliary models during fine-tuning to improve transferability of the attacks is a trend also applicable to standard image classification.\n\n3.  **Transferability to Commercial VLMs:**\n\n    *   A key finding is that adversarial images generated by AnyAttack can successfully transfer to *commercial* VLMs (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT). This means that these models are also vulnerable, even though their internal workings are not accessible.\n    *   This highlights the importance of testing and evaluating robustness across different model architectures and training regimes, as vulnerabilities can be surprisingly widespread.\n\n4.  **Evaluation on Multiple VLMs and Tasks:**\n\n    *   The paper presents extensive experimental results on various open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT-4) and across several multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, multimodal classification, image captioning).\n    *   This comprehensive evaluation helps to establish the generality and effectiveness of the AnyAttack framework.\n\n**Related Works (Trends in Adversarial Robustness and Attacks, relevant to image classification):**\n\nThe \"Related Work\" section, while primarily focused on VLMs, mentions techniques that are relevant to adversarial robustness in general image classification:\n\n*   **Input Augmentation:** Using techniques like image translation, cropping, mixup, and resizing to increase the diversity of adversarial inputs and improve transferability.\n*   **Adversarial Fine-tuning and Model Enhancement:** Retraining surrogate models with a mix of clean and adversarial examples to make them more robust against attacks.\n*   **Optimization Techniques:** Using adaptive learning rates and gradient clipping to stabilize the training process for adversarial attacks.\n\n**Specific Findings from Experiments (with potential implications for image classification robustness):**\n\n*   **Effectiveness of Auxiliary Models:** The paper found that using auxiliary models during the fine-tuning stage significantly improved the transferability of the attacks.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper, addressing the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\" I'm focusing on aspects related to adversarial robustness, transferability, and techniques published recently.\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on improving the *transferability* of adversarial examples in image classification, particularly in black-box attack scenarios.  It addresses the challenge that adversarial examples crafted in a white-box setting often fail to transfer well to other models, especially adversarially trained ones. The core idea is to leverage style transfer techniques to create more robust and transferable adversarial examples. The paper was published in **2023**.\n\n**Key Ideas and Contributions**\n\n*   **Style Transfer Method (STM):** The central contribution is a novel attack method called STM. STM uses an arbitrary style transfer network to transform input images into different \"domains\" (in terms of low-level visual features).\n\n    *   **Motivation:** The authors observe that existing input transformation-based attacks mainly augment data within the *same* domain, limiting transferability. They draw an analogy to domain generalization, arguing that using data from different domains can improve adversarial transferability.\n    *   **Arbitrary Style Transfer:**  STM uses a style transfer network to alter the style (texture, contrast, etc.) of an image while preserving its semantic content.\n    *   **Fine-tuning for Semantic Consistency:** To prevent the stylized images from misleading the surrogate model (the model used to generate the adversarial examples), the style transfer network is fine-tuned. The fine-tuning ensures the generated images are still correctly classified by a set of classification models.\n    *   **Mixing with Original Image:** The stylized image is mixed with the original image to further maintain semantic consistency and avoid introducing \"imprecise\" gradients during the adversarial example generation process.\n    *   **Random Noise:** Random noise is added to the stylized images for further diversity.\n*   **Input Transformation:** The paper notes that input transformation is a popular method for boosting adversarial transferability.\n*   **Domain Generalization:** The paper discusses domain generalization with style transfer networks and how that inspired their approach. They noted that introducing data from different domains to craft adversarial examples can also improve adversarial transferability.\n\n**Latest Trends (Based on the Paper's Context & References)**\n\nWhile the paper itself is a contribution to recent trends, it also discusses other trends and relevant works. Here's a breakdown of recent trends it highlights, keeping in mind the 2-year window:\n\n1.  **Input Transformation-Based Attacks:**\n\n    *   *General Trend:* Using various input transformations (resizing, padding, translation, scaling, mixing) to improve the transferability of adversarial examples.\n    *   *Specific Methods (mentioned and implicitly representing trends):*\n        *   **Diverse Input Method (DIM):** Randomly resizing and padding images. (Xie et al., 2019)\n        *   **Translation-Invariant Method (TIM):** Using translated images. (Dong et al., 2019)\n        *   **Scale-Invariant Method (SIM):** Averaging gradients over different scaled images. (Lin et al., 2019)\n        *   **Admix:** Mixing images from different categories. (Wang et al., 2021)\n        *   **S[2]IM:** Spectrum simulation attack using Discrete Cosine Transform to transform the input image in the frequency domain. (Long et al., 2022)\n    *   *Paper's Critique:* The paper argues that these methods are limited because they primarily use data augmentation within the *same* domain.\n\n2.  **Optimization-Based Approaches:**\n\n    *   *General Trend:* Improving the optimization process used to generate adversarial examples.\n    *   *Specific Methods (mentioned):*\n        *   **Momentum-Integrated I-FGSM (MI-FGSM):** Integrating momentum into the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM). (Dong et al., 2018)\n        *   **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient:** Using Nesterov's accelerated gradient. (Lin et al., 2019)\n        *   **Variance Tuning:** Tuning the gradient variance of previous iterations. (Wang & He, 2021)\n        *   **Enhanced Momentum:** Accumulating the gradient of several data points in the direction of the previous gradient. (Wang et al., 2021)\n\n3.  **Ensemble-Based Attacks:**\n\n    *   *General Trend:* Attacking an ensemble of models simultaneously to improve transferability. (Liu et al., 2016 is an older reference, but the paper utilizes this).\n\n4.  **Domain Generalization Techniques:**\n\n    *   *General Trend:* Inspired by domain generalization techniques, particularly those using style transfer, to improve robustness.\n    *   *Specific Methods (mentioned):*\n        *   **Style Augmentation:** Using style transfer as a data augmentation technique. (Jackson et al., 2019)\n\n5.  **Defense Methods:**\n\n    *   *General Trend:* The paper implicitly acknowledges the trend of developing defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks by evaluating its attack against adversarially trained models, as well as other defense mechanisms.\n    *   *Specific Methods (mentioned):*\n        *   **Adversarial Training:** Training models on adversarial examples to improve robustness. (Madry et al., 2017; Tram\u00e8r et al., 2017)\n        *   **Bit-Red** (Xu et al., 2018)\n        *   **ComDefend** (Jia et al., 2019)\n        *   **JPEG** (Guo et al., 2018)\n        *   **HGD** (Liao et al., 2018)\n        *   **R&P** (Xie et al., 2018)\n        *   **NIPS-r3** (Naseer et al., 2020)\n        *   **RS** (Cohen et al., 2019)\n        *   **NPR** (Naseer et al., 2020)\n\n**Key Takeaways for Answering the Research Question**\n\n*   A significant trend in adversarial robustness research involves improving the *transferability* of attacks, particularly in black-box settings.\n*   Input transformation techniques are a popular way to achieve this, but recent work (including this paper) is exploring how to make these transformations more effective.\n*   Drawing inspiration from domain generalization, researchers are exploring ways to introduce more diverse data (in terms of style, features, etc.) during the adversarial example generation process. Style transfer is emerging as a valuable tool in this area.\n*   There's a continuous arms race between attack and defense methods, with researchers constantly developing new defenses and, in turn, new attacks to bypass them.\n\nIn summary, the paper highlights a trend towards more sophisticated input transformation techniques, inspired by domain generalization, to create adversarial examples that are more transferable and can evade a wider range of defenses. The use of style transfer to achieve this is a particularly interesting and recent development."

It evaluates the defense against adversarial attacks and analyzes its vulnerabilities, fitting the research question's focus on adversarial robustness and latest trends.",
      "summary": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided paper, focusing on the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"  Here's a breakdown of the relevant information, extracted and interpreted from the document:\n\n**Overall Trend (based on the paper's argument):**\n\nThe paper highlights a critical trend:  Many defenses proposed against adversarial examples are ultimately shown to be ineffective upon more rigorous evaluation. The cycle involves a defense being proposed, claims of robustness being made, and then the defense being broken by an adaptive attack that overcomes the initial evaluation's limitations. This suggests a significant focus on the *evaluation* of defenses and the development of stronger attack methodologies to properly assess robustness. The paper argues that this cycle is still relevant as of 2024 with the \"Ensemble everything everywhere\" defense.\n\n**Key elements and Techniques from the paper relevant to current trends (within the last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Emphasis on Adaptive Attacks:**\n\n    *   The paper *explicitly* demonstrates the need for adaptive attacks to properly evaluate defenses. Standard \"off-the-shelf\" attacks like AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020) may be insufficient.\n    *   The defense (\"Ensemble everything everywhere\" - Fort & Lakshminarayanan, 2024) appeared robust against AutoAttack initially, but was broken with a more carefully constructed adaptive attack within this paper.\n\n2.  **Gradient Masking and Mitigation:**\n\n    *   Gradient masking remains a significant problem.  Defenses can *appear* robust by obfuscating gradients, making it difficult for gradient-based attacks to find adversarial examples.\n    *   The paper investigates gradient masking as a reason for the initial (overstated) robustness claims of the \"Ensemble everything everywhere\" defense.\n    *   The adaptive attack developed in the paper specifically addresses gradient masking by:\n\n        *   Attacking a modified version of the defense *without* the \"CrossMax\" aggregation function (which is identified as a source of gradient masking).\n        *   Transferring adversarial examples generated against this modified version to the actual defense.\n        *   Using Expectation over Transformation (EoT) to average gradients across multiple random transformations, smoothing out the loss landscape and overcoming masking effects.\n\n3.  **Expectation over Transformation (EoT):**\n\n    *   This technique (Athalye et al., 2018) is a standard approach to handle defenses that incorporate randomness. By averaging gradients over multiple forward and backward passes with different random seeds, the attack can obtain a more reliable estimate of the gradient direction. The paper confirms the value of this technique.\n\n4.  **Importance of Rigorous Evaluation Methodologies:**\n\n    *   The paper strongly emphasizes the need for careful and thorough evaluation of defenses. It highlights that flaws in defenses can often be revealed using existing techniques, but require a systematic and rigorous approach.\n    *   The paper advises to test attacks rigorously and save the adversarial examples to disk, and then have a second standalone script that solely evaluates the attack against the original defense and data. This avoids errors.\n\n5.  **Attack Techniques Combined:**\n\n    *   The successful adaptive attack combined several techniques:\n        *   Standard Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) with a large number of steps\n        *   Transfer attacks from a model *without* CrossMax\n        *   Expectation over Transformation (EoT)\n        *   \"Bag of Tricks\" - additional PGD steps, more EoT steps, change of loss function.\n    *   An alternative APGD attack (based on Croce & Hein, 2020) was also used, leveraging an adaptive step size schedule, transfer attacks, EoT, and a larger initial perturbation radius.\n\n**Specific details about \"Ensemble everything everywhere\" defense:**\n\n*   **Year:** 2024 (Fort & Lakshminarayanan)\n*   **Core idea:** Ensembling a model\u2019s intermediate representations at multiple noisy image resolutions.\n*   **Claims:** Initial claims of state-of-the-art robustness.\n*   **Broken by:** This paper, using adaptive attacks.\n\n**Other papers cited in the last 2 years:**\n\n*   Liu et al., 2024. Towards better adversarial purification via adversarial denoising diffusion training.\n*   Fort and Lakshminarayanan, 2024. Ensemble everything everywhere: Multi-scale aggregation for adversarial robustness\n*   Schlarmann, Croce, and Hein, 2024. Public comment: Robustness evaluation seems invalid.\n*   Fort, 2025. A note on implementation errors in recent adaptive attacks against multi-resolution self-ensembles\n\n**In summary:** The paper contributes to the trend of showing that many defenses are not as robust as initially claimed, emphasizing the need for more robust evaluation techniques and the development of adaptive attacks to identify vulnerabilities. The combination of existing attack methodologies, coupled with careful attention to gradient masking and the use of techniques like EoT, appears to be a key trend in breaking defenses."

Important Caveats and Limitations**\n\n*   **Publication Dates Unknown:** The absence of dates makes it impossible to strictly adhere to the \"last 2 years\" criterion. The information reflects the landscape at the time the survey was compiled.\n*   **3D Point Clouds, Not Images:** The paper explicitly focuses on *3D point cloud classification*. The principles may have some overlap with image classification, but the specific techniques and challenges are different.\n*   **Survey Nature:** This is a survey paper, so it reflects *other* research. The true \"latest trends\" would require examining the papers *cited* within this survey (and their publication dates).\n\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of adversarial attacks and defenses in the domain of 3D point cloud classification. While it doesn't directly address image classification, it highlights key attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and open challenges that are relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness. The key trends, at the time of the survey, involve developing more realistic attacks (black-box), understanding the role of frequency, improving training strategies, and expanding the scope of research to new tasks and point cloud attributes."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThis paper focuses on a specific niche within adversarial robustness: **reversible adversarial attacks** using **local visible adversarial perturbations**. This is a technique designed to protect image privacy while maintaining the usability of the original image.  It aims to create adversarial examples that can fool image classification models but can also be perfectly reversed to recover the original image.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness):**\n\nWhile the paper *doesn't* directly address the broad spectrum of \"latest trends in adversarial robustness,\" it *does* represent a trend toward:\n\n1.  **Privacy-Preserving Adversarial Attacks:**  The motivation behind reversible attacks is explicitly stated as protecting image privacy from unauthorized access by deep learning models. This reflects a growing awareness and research interest in using adversarial techniques not just to break models but to safeguard data.\n2.  **Usable Adversarial Examples:** The paper highlights the limitations of traditional adversarial perturbations that destroy the original data, making it unusable for other purposes. This showcases a trend toward creating adversarial examples that are useful or reversible, not just destructive.\n3.  **Visible Perturbations and Patches:** While much adversarial research focuses on imperceptible perturbations, this paper tackles the challenge of reversibility when using *visible* adversarial patches. This is relevant because adversarial patches offer advantages in terms of scene independence and ease of application in the real world.\n4.  **Combining Adversarial Attacks with Information Hiding:** The core of the reversible attack relies on cleverly combining adversarial attack techniques with reversible information hiding (steganography).

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Please note:** This paper primarily focuses on *image-to-image* models, *not* image classification. However, it *does* discuss the applicability of image classification robustness techniques to image-to-image models and touches on related concepts.  I will highlight those aspects and also point out where the paper contrasts image-to-image with image classification.  Given that the research question specifies a focus *only* on the last 2 years, I will prioritize information and references published within that timeframe *if available*.\n\n**I. Key Findings Related to the Research Question (Adversarial Robustness for Image Classification, where applicable based on the paper):**\n\n*   **Transferability of Universal Perturbations:**\n    *   The paper investigates the transferability of adversarial examples *between image-to-image models and image classification models* (VGG16 [26], ResNet101 [27], MobileNetV2 [28]). This is relevant because it explores whether attacks crafted for one type of model (image-to-image) can fool another (image classification), shedding light on shared vulnerabilities and the generalizability of adversarial robustness techniques.  The paper notes that transferability *between* image-to-image and image classification models is generally lower than transferability within each type. However, it also notes some surprising instances where attacks *do* transfer (e.g., attacks from a DnCNN image-to-image model successfully fooling MobileNetV2).\n    *   The paper mentions that \"In most cases, the transferability of universal perturbations between an image-to-image model and an image classification model is lower than that between image-to-image models or image classification models, which can be easily understood.\" This suggests that the features learned by these different types of networks are different, leading to a reduction in transferability.\n\n*   **Frequency-Aware Attacks:**\n    *   The paper investigates manipulating frequency components during the I-FGSM attack process. This technique, *recently applied to the classification task* (referencing [29] and [30]), is adapted for image-to-image models in this study. This shows a trend of researchers exploring frequency-based vulnerabilities and defenses in adversarial robustness, though this paper's focus is on image-to-image.  The referenced papers [29] and [30] should be investigated further for trends directly related to image classification.\n\n*   **Defense Methods:**\n    *   The paper evaluates the feasibility of defending *image-to-image* models using defense methods \"that have been widely used for image classification models.\" This highlights a trend of *adapting* existing classification defenses for other tasks. The methods considered include:\n        *   Image Transformation: JPEG compression [18], random resizing [20], bit reduction [19].\n        *   Adversarial Training: Using adversarial examples generated by I-FGSM as training data [1, 12, 21].\n        *   Geometric Self-Ensemble: A technique from super-resolution [5].\n    *   The paper finds that these defenses *do* reduce the impact of adversarial attacks to some extent (reducing the VI - Vulnerability Index). However, they also often degrade the original, non-attacked performance of the image-to-image models.\n    *   The conclusion here is significant: \"the existing defense methods developed for image classification models are not well-suited for image-to-image models.\" This underscores the need for *task-specific* robustness techniques and suggests that trends in image classification robustness may not directly translate to other domains.\n\n*   **GANs and Vulnerability:** The paper found that models trained with GANs usually produce perceptually appealing sharp textures and the perturbation in the input image tends to be intensified in the output image.\n\n**II. Specific References That Might Indicate Trends (and meet the <2 year criteria):**\n\nI've included these because the paper cites them, and they could lead you to more direct answers to your research question, even if this paper itself isn't directly about image classification trends.\n\n*   **[3] Y.

Trends Inferred From the Paper's Discussion (but requiring further investigation):**\n\n*   **Focus on Transferability:** Several references ([16], [17], [25]) point to a trend of investigating and trying to improve the *transferability* of adversarial attacks.  This means making attacks that can fool models even when the attacker doesn't have full knowledge of the target model.\n*   **Adversarial Training Remains a Key Defense:** The mention of \"Bag of Tricks for Adversarial Training\" [21] suggests that adversarial training continues to be a major area of research, with researchers looking for ways to make it more effective.\n*   **Frequency-Based Vulnerabilities:** The adaptation of frequency-aware attacks [29, 30] indicates a trend toward exploiting frequency-domain vulnerabilities in neural networks.\n\n**IV. Limitations & Caveats:**\n\n*   **Image-to-Image Focus:** The paper's primary focus is NOT image classification. The information extracted here is based on the *connections* and *comparisons* the paper makes to image classification. Direct research on image classification is needed for a comprehensive answer.\n*   **Reference Dates:** Pay close attention to the publication dates of the cited papers. Some may fall outside your desired \"last 2 years\" window.\n*   **Generality:** The trends inferred here are based on a *single* paper. A broader literature review is essential to confirm these trends.\n\nIn summary, while this paper isn't directly *about* the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, it *does* highlight some relevant areas like transferability, frequency-based attacks, and the adaptation of classification defense techniques to other tasks.  The cited references are valuable starting points for further investigation, focusing on those published within the last 2 years. You'll need to read those papers directly to get a true picture of the trends in image classification robustness."

This is a crucial distinction from general image classification. The finding that medical images may be *more* vulnerable than natural images (Ma et al., 2020) is significant.\n\n2.  **Adversarial Training as a Defense:** The paper uses adversarial training as the primary defense strategy, which aligns with a broader trend in the field. The core idea is to train models on adversarial examples to make them more robust.\n\n3.  **Improvements to Adversarial Training:** The paper *itself* contributes to this trend by proposing two *improved* adversarial training methods: MPAdvT and MAAdvT. These methods aim to address limitations of standard adversarial training (e.g., fixed perturbation levels, neglecting misclassified examples).\n\n    *   **MPAdvT (Multi-Perturbations Adversarial Training):** Trains models with *varying* perturbation levels and iteration steps during training.\n    *   **MAAdvT (Misclassification-Aware Adversarial Training):** Focuses on the impact of misclassified examples during training and incorporates a regularization term to improve robustness on these examples.\n\n4.  **Robustness Benchmarks:** The creation of the _Robust-Benchmark_ dataset reflects a trend towards creating standardized benchmarks for evaluating the robustness of models against common perturbations (beyond just adversarial attacks).\n\n5.  **Trade-offs Between Accuracy and Robustness:** The paper acknowledges the inherent trade-off between accuracy and robustness, a common theme in adversarial robustness research.\n\n6.  **Provable Robustness (Future Direction):** The discussion section mentions \"provable\" or \"certified\" robustness as a future direction. This is a more advanced area that aims to provide mathematical guarantees about the robustness of a model within certain bounds.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Paper Age:** The paper is from early 2021. The field of adversarial robustness is rapidly evolving, so newer research would likely build upon these findings.\n*   **Medical Image Focus:** The paper's primary focus is on *medical* images. While the general principles of adversarial robustness apply, the specific characteristics of medical images and the clinical context are important considerations.\n*   **Limited Scope of Defenses:** The paper primarily focuses on adversarial training-based defenses. Other defense strategies (e.g., input preprocessing, certified defenses) are only briefly mentioned.\n\n**In summary, this paper highlights the growing concern of adversarial attacks on medical image classification systems and contributes to the trend of improving adversarial training techniques. It acknowledges the challenges and points towards future research directions like provable robustness. To get a complete picture of current trends, it is essential to consult more recent publications (2022-2024) that build upon these foundations.**"

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to extract the relevant information about recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on the last 2 years.\n\n**Paper Focus and Limitations:**\n\n*   This paper primarily addresses **adversarial robustness in *medical image segmentation***, specifically *volumetric* (3D) data. While relevant, it's not directly about *image classification* robustness in general, but insights can be transferable.\n*   The paper's focus on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) benchmark is a strength for its specific domain, but a limitation if you're looking for broad trends across all image classification tasks.\n\n**Key Findings and Contributions (Relevant to Adversarial Robustness Trends):**\n\n1.  **Extension of AutoAttack to 3D Segmentation:**\n\n    *   The paper extends the AutoAttack framework, originally designed for *image classification*, to the domain of 3D medical image segmentation. AutoAttack is a \"parameter-free ensemble of attacks\" considered a leading benchmark for assessing adversarial robustness. It comprises:\n        *   AutoPGD-CE (Projected Gradient Descent with Cross-Entropy loss)\n        *   AutoPGD-DLR (Projected Gradient Descent with Difference-of-Logits Ratio)\n        *   FAB-T (Fast Adaptive Boundary attack - targeted)\n        *   Square Attack (Black-box attack based on random search)\n    *   **Relevance:** This highlights the *continued relevance and adaptation of strong, ensemble-based attack frameworks* for robustness evaluation.  The fact that AutoAttack *from image classification* is being adapted to other domains suggests its influence.\n    *   The adaptation involved redefining the notion of \"attack success\" for segmentation, using a drop in Dice score as the metric.\n\n2.  **Introduction of ROG (Robust Generic Medical Image Segmentation):**\n\n    *   The authors propose a novel \"lattice architecture\" called ROG designed to be robust against adversarial perturbations in medical image segmentation.\n    *   **Relevance:** The development of specialized architectures tailored for robustness in specific domains (here, medical imaging) demonstrates a trend toward *domain-aware robustness solutions*.\n    *   ROG uses \"Free\" Adversarial Training (AT) for efficiency.\n\n3.  **Effectiveness of \"Free\" Adversarial Training (Free AT):**\n\n    *   The paper uses \"Free\" Adversarial Training [Shafahi et al., NeurIPS 2019] to improve the robustness of ROG. Free AT is an efficient version of adversarial training. They set the attack strength (epsilon) to 8/255 and replay the image 5 times for gradient computation.\n    *   **Relevance:** The findings suggest that *adversarial training, particularly efficient variants like \"Free\" AT, remains a viable and important technique* for improving robustness. The parameters used (epsilon, replay count) offer practical insights.\n    *   The results showed that \"training with Free AT is a tractable approach to improving adversarial robustness of DNNs\" and often enhances robustness without significant performance degradation on clean samples.  They observed better robustness improvements for larger, well-defined structures.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Individual Attacks within AutoAttack:**\n\n    *   They tested each attack within AutoAttack separately. The PGD-based attacks (AutoPGD-CE and AutoPGD-DLR) were the strongest.\n    *   FAB-T performed poorly, leading the authors to hypothesize that its decision-boundary approximation approach might not be well-suited for segmentation.\n    *   The Square attack, despite being a black-box method, consistently found adversarial examples, albeit with high computational cost.\n    *   **Relevance:** This highlights the *diversity of adversarial attacks and the need for comprehensive robustness evaluations using multiple attack strategies*. The limitations of FAB-T for segmentation indicate the *task-specific nature of attack effectiveness*. The success of Square attack, even with high cost, reinforces the importance of considering black-box threats.\n\n5.  **Vulnerability of Existing Methods (nnUNet):**\n\n    *   The paper evaluated the robustness of nnUNet, a top-performing method in the MSD, and found it to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  nnUNet's segmentations were easily \"shattered\" by adversarial noise.\n    *   Qualitative results suggested that nnUNet might be overly reliant on high-contrast boundaries, indicating a strong inductive bias.\n    *   **Relevance:** This highlights the *importance of rigorously testing existing state-of-the-art methods for adversarial robustness*, as high accuracy on clean data does not guarantee robustness.\n\n**Specific Mentions of Relevant Papers (Within the Last 2 Years, i.e., 2021-2022 from the time the paper was written, which may be older):**\n\n*   **Joel, M.Z., et al. (2021):** \"Adversarial attack vulnerability of deep learning models for oncologic images.\"  (This is a direct reference to adversarial attacks in the *medical image* domain.)\n*   **Xie, C., et al. (2020):** \"Smooth adversarial training.\" (Mentioned in relation to Swish activations and their benefit for adversarial training.)\n*   **Croce, F., Hein, M. (2020):** \"Reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness with an ensemble of diverse parameter-free attacks.\" (This is the AutoAttack paper, central to their methodology.)\n*   **Croce, F., Hein, M.

(2020):** \"C2fnas: Coarse-to-fine neural architecture search for 3d medical image segmentation.\"\n\n**Trends and Implications:**\n\n*   **Continued Importance of Strong Attacks:** The adoption and adaptation of AutoAttack demonstrate the ongoing need for powerful and comprehensive attack methodologies to thoroughly evaluate robustness.\n*   **Adversarial Training Remains Key:** Efficient adversarial training techniques (like Free AT) are practical and effective for improving robustness, even in computationally demanding domains.\n*   **Domain-Specific Robustness:** The development of ROG highlights a trend toward designing architectures specifically for robustness in particular application areas.\n*   **Robustness Evaluation is Crucial:**  The vulnerability of nnUNet underscores the importance of systematically evaluating the adversarial robustness of even state-of-the-art methods.\n*   **Ensemble methods**: Robustness is increased by attacking with an ensemble of attacks such as AutoAttack.\n\n**Limitations Regarding Image Classification (General):**\n\n*   The paper's primary contribution is in *medical image segmentation*. It doesn't provide direct insight into specific architectures or techniques that are *new* in general image classification robustness *beyond* the adaptation of AutoAttack and the use of adversarial training.\n*   The focus on volumetric data and the MSD benchmark limits the generalizability of some findings.\n\n**In summary:** While not directly addressing image classification, the paper provides valuable insights into adversarial robustness trends.  It demonstrates the continued relevance of strong attack ensembles (like AutoAttack), the effectiveness of efficient adversarial training, and the importance of domain-aware robustness solutions, while highlighting the potential vulnerabilities of existing high-accuracy models. The trends are the *application* of existing adversarial robustness techniques in a new domain (medical imaging)."

This \"off-manifold\" behavior is the key to their defense strategy.\n\n*   **Textual Manifold-based Defense (TMD) - Adaptable to Images:** The paper proposes a defense mechanism that *projects embeddings of potentially adversarial inputs back onto an approximation of the natural data manifold* *before* classification.  This reduces the \"complexity\" of adversarial examples, increasing robustness. The paper claims this is the first NLP defense leveraging the manifold structure.\n\n**How TMD (Adaptable to Image Domain) Works:**\n\n1.  **Manifold Approximation (Training Phase):**\n    *   A generative model (specifically, an InfoGAN) is trained on the continuous representations (embeddings) of natural, non-adversarial images.\n    *   This generative model *implicitly learns an approximation of the natural image manifold*.\n    *   The generative model uses a learnable prior distribution that is optimized to reflect the true distribution of natural images, rather than assuming a uniform distribution. This helps the model to learn a more accurate representation of the image manifold.\n\n2.  **On-Manifold Projection (Inference Phase):**\n    *   Given an unseen input image, its embedding is extracted.\n    *   A \"sampling-based reconstruction\" method is used to *project this embedding onto the learned image manifold*.  Essentially, the method searches for a point *on* the manifold that is \"close\" to the original adversarial embedding.\n    *   The reconstructed (projected) embedding is then fed to the classifier for a final prediction.\n\n**Advantages Claimed (Adaptable to Image Domain):**\n\n*   Improved robustness *without significantly sacrificing clean accuracy*.\n*   The method is *structure-free* (adaptable to different model architectures).\n\n**Experimental Setup & Results (Adaptable to Image Domain):**\n\n*   **Datasets:**  While the paper uses text datasets (AG-News, IMDB, Yelp), the concept is readily transferable to image classification datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, or ImageNet.\n*   **Model Architectures:** They experiment with BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet (text models).  For images, one could use CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG) or vision transformers.\n*   **Adversarial Attacks:** The paper uses PWWS, TextFooler, and BERT-Attack (text attacks).  For images, common attacks include FGSM, PGD, and C&W.\n*   **Baseline Defenses:** ASCC, DNE, and SAFER are used as baseline defenses.\n*   **Key Findings (Adaptable to Image Domain):**\n    *   TMD (adapted to images) outperforms other defenses under various attack settings.\n    *   The off-manifold conjecture is supported empirically \u2013 adversarial examples *do* tend to have embeddings that are further from the natural data manifold.\n\n**Importance of Disconnectedness in the Contextualized Manifold Approximation:**\n* The paper demonstrates the importance of using disconnected generative models (InfoGAN) compared to connected ones (DCGAN) for approximating the contextualized embedding manifold. DCGAN performs worse than InfoGAN, leading to a degradation in clean accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks.\n\n**Ablation Studies (Adaptable to Image Domain):**\n\n*   **Sampling Size (k):** There's an optimal number of samples (`k`) to use when projecting back onto the manifold. Too few, and the reconstruction is poor; too many, and the method samples from low-probability regions of the latent space, hurting robustness.\n*   **Optimization-Based Reconstruction vs. Sampling:** Simple sampling for reconstruction works better than optimization-based approaches (like gradient descent on the latent space).  The authors hypothesize that optimization methods can move latent variables to low-probability regions, decreasing robustness.\n\n**Limitations & Future Directions:**\n\n*   Computational overhead of the on-manifold projection step.\n*   Exploring reconstruction at intermediate layers.\n*   Alternative methods for constructing text embeddings (the study uses [CLS] tokens).\n*   More sophisticated manifold approximation models and reconstruction methods.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Image Classification & Adversarial Robustness (Within the Last 2 Years):**\n\n1.  **Manifold-Based Defenses are Promising:** This paper provides further evidence that leveraging the structure of the data manifold can be an effective defense strategy against adversarial attacks.\n\n2.  **Off-Manifold is a Valid Hypothesis:**  The \"off-manifold conjecture\" remains a relevant perspective for understanding adversarial examples.\n\n3.  **Generative Models are Useful:**  Generative models (like GANs and VAEs) can be used to *learn* approximations of the data manifold for defense purposes. InfoGANs were found to work best in this paper.\n\n4.  **Careful Reconstruction is Key:** The method of projecting back onto the manifold (reconstruction) is crucial. Simple sampling strategies can outperform more complex optimization methods.\n\n5.  **Computational Cost:** Manifold-based methods can add computational overhead. Optimization and efficiency are important considerations.\n\n6.  **Learnable Priors:** The paper emphasizes the use of learnable priors in the generative model to better capture the true distribution of natural images, rather than assuming a uniform distribution."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the provided paper, specifically focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years (from the perspective of the paper's publication date).\n\n**Paper Title:** Medical Aegis: Robust adversarial protectors for medical images\n\n**Key Focus and Contribution:**\n\n*   The paper addresses the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in medical image analysis to adversarial attacks, particularly adaptive attacks where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense mechanism.\n*   It proposes a novel two-tier defense system called \"Medical Aegis,\" comprising:\n    *   **Cushion:** A proactive defense that weakens adversarial manipulation by removing high-frequency components from the input image.  This aims to reduce the attacker's ability to manipulate medical features. It uses JPEG compression.\n    *   **Shield:** A reactive defense that detects adversarial examples by identifying and purging adversarial features, inspired by the observation that robust trails exist in the shallow layers of a deep network. It leverages adversarial training.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness Trends (within the last 2 years):**\n\nThe paper touches upon several trends in adversarial robustness research relevant to the specified timeframe (assuming the paper was published in late 2021 or 2022):\n\n1.  **Adaptive Attacks are the Main Threat:** The paper emphasizes a shift in focus from defending against basic adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, BIM) to defending against *adaptive* attacks. Adaptive attacks are designed with full knowledge of the defense mechanism, making them significantly more challenging to defend against. This aligns with a major trend in the field where researchers are developing more sophisticated attacks that can bypass existing defenses. They specifically cite \\[1, 2, 34] which are from 2018, 2017, and 2020 respectively, showcasing the recent interest in adaptive attacks.\n\n2.  **Limitations of Existing Defenses:**  The paper highlights the shortcomings of traditional defense strategies, including:\n    *   **Proactive Defenses (e.g., Adversarial Training, Input Transformation):** While adversarial training \\[35] (likely referring to the original Goodfellow paper and its variants) is a well-known technique, the paper notes that it can scarify model performance \\[36] and be computationally expensive \\[31]. Input transformations, such as JPEG compression \\[9], can be bypassed by adaptive attacks like BPDA \\[1].\n    *   **Reactive Defenses (e.g., Anomaly Detection, Learning-based Detection):**  The paper points out that reactive defenses, which aim to detect adversarial examples *after* they've been generated, are also vulnerable to adaptive attacks \\[39]. Methods like RBF-SVM \\[22], DNN-based detection \\[26], Kernel Density Estimation \\[10], Local Intrinsic Dimensionality \\[23], and Mahalanobis distance-based methods \\[19] have all been shown to be bypassable.\n\n3.  **Importance of Feature Analysis and Shallow Layers:** A key contribution is the observation that adversarial attacks, even adaptive ones, leave \"robust trails\" in the shallow layers of DNNs. This suggests a trend towards analyzing the features learned by different layers of a network to identify vulnerabilities and develop more effective defenses. The stress tests they performed on the features from different layers support the fact that deep features are vulnerable. Shallow features are also affected, albeit not as significantly as deep features.\n\n4.  **Defense as an Arms Race (Adversarial Training):** The Shield component of Medical Aegis utilizes adversarial training, framing the defense problem as an ongoing \"arm race\" between the defender and the attacker.  This reflects a common understanding in the field that defenses must continuously adapt to the evolving attack strategies.\n\n5.  **The Use of Input Preprocessing:** The paper uses JPEG compression as a \"Cushion\" which acts as a preprocessing step to remove high-frequency components. This is in line with a trend of using input transformations to improve robustness. However, the paper also acknowledges that these techniques can be bypassed if the attacker is aware of the transformation and adapts their attack accordingly.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Approaches Mentioned (and their relevance):**\n\n*   **Attacks:**\n    *   FGSM \\[12], BIM \\[18], MIM \\[7], PGD \\[25]: These are standard gradient-based attacks, useful for benchmarking but not representative of the most sophisticated attacks.\n    *   CW \\[3]:  Carlini-Wagner attack is considered a strong attack, often used to evaluate the effectiveness of defenses.\n    *   DIM \\[37], TIM \\[8]: Diverse Input Method and Translation-Invariant Method are mentioned, suggesting an awareness of techniques to improve the *transferability* of adversarial examples (making them effective across different models).\n    *   Transfer Attack (TF) \\[21]: A black-box attack where an adversarial example generated on one model is used to attack another.\n    *   Feature Attack (Fea) \\[30]: Generates adversarial features equal to a natural one.\n    *   Hierarchical Feature Constraint (HFC) \\[39]: Pushes adversarial features toward the normal distribution of the targeted class. This is a more sophisticated adaptive attack.\n    *   White-box Attack (WB): The attacker has full knowledge of the defense (Shield).\n\n*   **Defenses:**\n    *   Adversarial Training \\[35]:  A core defense technique, but with noted limitations.\n    *   JPEG Compression \\[9]: Used as a proactive defense (\"Cushion\").\n    *   Anomaly Detection (KD \\[10], LID \\[23], MAHA \\[19]): Reactive defenses based on detecting outliers in the feature space.\n    *   DNN-based Detection \\[26]: Training a DNN to classify adversarial vs. clean examples.\n\n**Experiments and Results:**\n\n*   The paper evaluates Medical Aegis on medical image datasets (Kaggle Fundoscopy, Chest X-Ray) using ResNet-50 \\[14] and VGG-16 \\[32] backbones.\n*   Results show that Medical Aegis achieves high accuracy against both conventional and adaptive attacks, exceeding the performance of other defenses.\n*   Ablation studies confirm the importance of using features from shallow layers and the effectiveness of the \"Cushion\" component.\n\n**Limitations Acknowledged:**\n\n*   A performance drop is observed for the Aegis when detecting CW attacks on the Fundoscopy dataset, suggesting potential overfitting to adaptive attacks.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThis paper reflects key trends in adversarial robustness research from the last 2 years (prior to its publication), emphasizing the growing importance of defending against adaptive attacks, the limitations of existing defense methods, and the potential of analyzing features from different network layers to develop more robust defenses.  The Medical Aegis system, with its two-tier approach and focus on shallow features, represents a valuable contribution to the field, particularly in the context of medical imaging."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the paper to address the research question:  \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Open-set Adversarial Defense with Clean-Adversarial Mutual Learning\n\n**Key Areas Addressed:**\n\n*   **Open-Set Adversarial Defense (OSAD):**  This is a core concept.  The paper identifies the problem that existing adversarial defense mechanisms trained on known classes don't generalize well to open-set samples (samples from classes not seen during training).  Similarly, open-set recognition methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  The trend here is recognizing the *combined* challenge.\n\n*   **Clean-Adversarial Mutual Learning:**  This is a significant proposed method.  It involves training a network with adversarial examples while *simultaneously* training a \"peer network\" on clean images.  The two networks then \"mutually learn\" from each other.  This leverages information from clean images to improve adversarial robustness.\n\n*   **Feature Denoising with Attention Mechanisms:**  The paper uses dual-attentive feature denoising layers in the encoder network.  These layers aim to remove adversarial noise by focusing on both channel-wise and spatial-wise attention. This is in contrast to older methods that focused on spatial denoising only.\n\n*   **Self-Supervised Learning for Robustness:** Rotation-based self-supervision is used as an auxiliary task. This involves training the network to recognize the angle of rotated images, which enhances its understanding of object structures and improves robustness against adversarial attacks.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Trends Highlighted:**\n\n*   **Autoencoders for Image Denoising:**  Using an autoencoder architecture (encoder-decoder) is presented as a way to generate noise-free images from adversarial inputs. The decoder's reconstruction capability provides an additional supervision signal for noise removal.  The latent space of the autoencoder is also thought to generate more descriptive features useful for open-set recognition.\n\n*   **Dual-Attentive Denoising Layers:** These layers are a key component of the proposed method. They perform feature denoising by using both channel-wise and spatial-wise attentive filters. This allows the network to learn \"where\" and \"what\" to emphasize or suppress during feature denoising, improving robustness.\n\n*   **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence for Mutual Learning:**  The clean-adversarial mutual learning uses KL divergence to match probability predictions between the adversarial classifier and the clean image classifier (peer learner).\n\n*   **Evaluation Protocols:**  The paper emphasizes evaluating adversarial defense mechanisms in an open-set setting, which is more realistic than traditional closed-set evaluations. The evaluation considers both closed-set accuracy and open-set detection performance (AUC-ROC). They use White-box attacks, Black-box attacks, and Rectangular Occlusion attacks.\n\n**Key Components of the Proposed Method (OSDN-CAML):**\n\n1.  **Encoder:** Extracts latent features from input images. Contains dual-attentive feature denoising layers.\n\n2.  **Decoder:** Reconstructs images from the latent features, facilitating noise removal and generating descriptive features.\n\n3.  **Open-Set Classifier:** Classifies images and identifies open-set samples using an OpenMax layer.\n\n4.  **Transformation Classifier:**  Performs self-supervision by predicting the transformation (rotation) applied to the input image.\n\n5.  **Peer Learner:** A classifier trained on clean images that mutually learns with the open-set classifier, improving feature denoising and generalization.\n\n**Comparison to Existing Methods & Baselines:**\n\nThe paper compares the proposed method with:\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** Training the network with adversarial examples.\n*   **Feature Denoising:**  Using denoising filters in the feature space.\n*   **OSDN (Open-Set Defense Network):** A preliminary version of this work from ECCV 2020. The main improvements in the current paper are the dual-attentive denoising layers and clean-adversarial mutual learning.\n\n**Results and Findings:**\n\n*   The proposed OSDN-CAML method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-set adversarial defense compared to the baselines.\n*   The dual-attentive denoising layers and clean-adversarial mutual learning contribute significantly to the improved performance.\n*   The method is robust against white-box attacks, black-box attacks, and rectangular occlusion attacks.\n*   Visualizations confirm that the method effectively reduces adversarial noise and separates open-set samples from known-class samples in the latent feature space.\n\n**Trends Summarized:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Open-Set Adversarial Defense:**  Moving beyond traditional adversarial robustness to consider robustness *and* the ability to detect unknown classes.\n2.  **Mutual Learning:** Using multiple networks trained with different data distributions (clean vs. adversarial) that learn from each other.\n3.  **Attention Mechanisms for Denoising:** Using attention to focus denoising efforts on the most relevant feature channels and spatial locations.\n4.  **Self-Supervision for Enhanced Feature Learning:** Using auxiliary self-supervised tasks to enhance the informativeness and robustness of the learned features.\n5.  **Generative Modeling:** Using decoders to generate clean images for added supervision.\n\n**Relevance to the Last 2 Years:**\n\n*   The paper was received and accepted within the last 2 years.\n*   The paper refers to ECCV 2020 conference, meaning research is up-to-date."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Time Traveling to Defend Against Adversarial Example Attacks in Image Classification\n\n**Overall Focus:** The paper introduces a novel defense mechanism against adversarial attacks in image classification, specifically targeting traffic sign classification. It leverages historical Street View images to detect and mitigate adversarial manipulations in real-time.  While the paper primarily focuses on a *defense* strategy, it touches upon recent *attack* methods to contextualize the problem.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Adversarial Robustness Trends):**\n\nThe paper implicitly addresses the research question by:\n\n1.  **Highlighting recent adversarial attack trends:** The paper demonstrates the practical application of adversarial attacks in a real-world scenario (traffic sign classification).

(2022) \\[31]. This attack leverages shadows as a natural and stealthy form of perturbation, making it difficult to detect. The paper modifies and applies this attack to real-life Street View images. This highlights a trend towards attacks that exploit natural phenomena.  The key idea here is that these attacks are more stealthy and bypass typical defenses.\n    *   **Natural Light Attacks:** The paper references Hsiao et al. (2024) \\[12], which demonstrated that natural light sources can be used to cause traffic sign misinterpretation. This further reinforces the trend of attacks leveraging environmental factors.\n    *   **Universal Adversarial Patches:** The paper mentions adversarial patches localized to a specific region of the image \\[4].\n    *   **Robust Physical Perturbations:**  The paper mentions Eykholt et al. \\[7] and their Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2) method, which incorporates real-world variability.\n\n*   **Limitations of Existing Defenses:**\n\n    *   The paper states that common defenses like adversarial training and input preprocessing often fail to generalize across diverse attack types and real-world conditions.\n    *   Adversarial training by adding shadows helps to decrease the success of the attack but it does not successfully defend against it in all cases, as shown in Table 2.\n\n*   **Defense Strategies Discussed (and Criticized):**\n\n    *   **Adversarial Training:**  Exposing the model to adversarial examples during training. The paper notes that adversarial training *can* improve robustness, but it has limitations and doesn't always generalize.\n    *   **Input Preprocessing:** Filtering adversarial noise.\n    *   **Defensive Distillation:** As proposed by Papernot et al. \\[22\\], this technique trains a distillation model using the original inputs and labels to generate a probability distribution, and then trains a new model of the same architecture.\n    *   **Gradient Masking:** Using S2SNet to mask the model\u2019s gradient to prevent attackers from exploiting gradient information \\[8\\].\n    *   **Randomized Smoothing:** The authors in \\[30\\] demonstrated that adversarial training with PGD attacks and randomized smoothing are limited in their effectiveness against high-profile physical attacks.\n\n*   **Proposed Defense (Time Traveling with Historical Images):**\n\n    *   **Concept:** The core idea is to leverage past, historical images of traffic signs (obtained from Street View) and compare them with the current input image.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Image classification is performed on both the past and present images, and majority voting is used to determine the correct classification, mitigating the impact of adversarial manipulations.\n    *   **Advantages:** The authors claim 100% effectiveness against the presented shadow attack. They argue that ubiquitous access to Street View makes this defense widely deployable.\n    *   **Limitations:** The defense relies on the availability of historical Street View data. It may not work for newly installed signs or in regions where Street View is unavailable. Changes in the street signs may result in incorrect classification.\n\n**Specific Citations of Relevant Papers (Within the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Hsiao et al.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on aspects related to the last 2 years (2022-2024).\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Transferability with ConvMixer:** The paper primarily investigates the adversarial transferability of ConvMixer models, an isotropic network incorporating CNNs, assessing its vulnerability to adversarial examples (AEs) generated from other models. It aims to understand if ConvMixer's transferability characteristics differ from those of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNNs.\n*   **Evaluation Methodology:** The paper uses AutoAttack, a benchmark for adversarial robustness, to generate adversarial examples (AEs) and objectively evaluate the transferability. The attack success rate (ASR) is used as a metric to quantify the transferability between models.\n\n**II. Relevant Trends and Techniques (within the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **ConvMixer and its Adversarial Robustness (Trend: Isotropic Networks):** The paper itself contributes to the trend of evaluating the adversarial robustness of newer architectures like ConvMixer.  ConvMixer is an isotropic network like ViT but uses CNNs.  The paper finds that ConvMixer is weak to adversarial transferability.\n*   **Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Adversarial Robustness (Trend: Transformers in Vision):** The paper references the trend of exploring the adversarial robustness of ViTs. It notes that prior work has shown that ViTs exhibit lower adversarial transferability with CNNs compared to the transferability *between* CNNs. The paper uses ViTs as a comparison point for ConvMixer. Reference [8] is the original ViT paper.\n*   **AutoAttack as a Robustness Benchmark (Trend: Standardized Evaluation):** The paper highlights the use of AutoAttack [2] as a crucial trend in adversarial robustness research. AutoAttack provides a standardized and rigorous evaluation framework using an ensemble of diverse attacks (APGD-ce, APGD-t, FAB-t, Square Attack). This addresses the issue of unreliable or easily circumvented defense methods.\n*   **Adversarial Transferability (Trend: Black-Box Attacks):** The investigation of adversarial transferability remains a relevant trend. The paper aims to understand how well AEs generated on one model (source model) can fool another, potentially unknown, model (target model). This is crucial for assessing the practical security risks in real-world scenarios (black-box attacks).\n*   **Encrypted Models for Adversarial Defense (Trend: Defense Mechanisms):** The paper explores the use of encrypted ConvMixer models as a potential defense against adversarial attacks.  This leverages block-wise image transformations with secret keys.  While the paper finds that encryption enhances robustness against direct attacks, it does not significantly reduce *adversarial transferability*. Reference [1] (Aprilpyone and Kiya, 2021) is relevant, but is outside of the 2-year window.\n*   **Learnable Image Transformation with Secret Key (Trend: Defense Mechanisms):** Reference [5] (Kiya et al., 2022) reviews the landscape of compressible and learnable image transformation with secret key and its applications.\n\n**III. Key Findings Related to Recent Trends:**\n\n*   **ConvMixer is Vulnerable:** The paper concludes that ConvMixer is vulnerable to adversarial transferability. AEs generated for ConvMixer are effective in attacking the ConvMixer model itself. However, AEs generated on other models do not transfer well to ConvMixer, and AEs generated for ConvMixer do not transfer well to other models.\n*   **Encrypted Models Offer Limited Transferability Defense:** Encrypting ConvMixer models can improve robustness against direct attacks, but it does not significantly mitigate the problem of adversarial transferability. In some cases, transferability *between* encrypted models is higher than between a plain ConvMixer and an encrypted one.\n\n**IV.

      "summary": "Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the relevant information concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing specifically on methods published or relevant in the last 2 years (approximately from late 2021 to late 2023, although the document itself doesn't explicitly state publication dates, only mentions work from 2016 onwards):\n\n**Overarching Theme:**\n\nThe document primarily focuses on methods for *detecting* and, to a lesser extent, *purifying* adversarial examples rather than making inherently robust classifiers. It explores different approaches to identify adversarial examples, which is a key aspect of achieving overall robustness.\n\n**Key Trends and Methods (Based on the Provided Text):**\n\nSeveral techniques are discussed, though it is important to note that the document provides a survey of older papers, so its comments on very recent trends are limited.  Here are some notable themes and specific methods:\n\n1.  **Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) for Detection (Prominently Featured):**\n\n    *   **Core Idea:**  Train a CVAE on clean images. During inference, use the CVAE to reconstruct the input image conditioned on the *predicted* class (from the classifier being defended).\n    *   **Detection Mechanism:** Adversarial examples, by definition, cause the classifier to misclassify.  Therefore, the CVAE receives the adversarial image *and* an incorrect class label.  The reconstruction error will be high because the CVAE is trying to generate an image of the incorrect class from an input that's been subtly altered.\n    *   **Advantages (as claimed by the paper):**\n        *   Distinguishes between adversarial perturbations and random noise (a common weakness of earlier detection methods).  Random noise, the document argues, often doesn't cause misclassification, so the CVAE still reconstructs using the correct class, resulting in a lower error.\n        *   Robust against white-box attacks (where the attacker knows the defense mechanism). The paper proposes techniques to detect targeted BIM attacks.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   Uses Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) for reconstruction loss.\n        *   Uses KL-divergence to keep the latent space distribution close to a unit Gaussian.\n        *   Employs a p-value test to determine the likelihood that an input belongs to the distribution of clean images, using reconstruction error as the test statistic.\n        *   The paper performs experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with the ResNet18 architecture.\n\n2.  **Purification using Variational Autoencoders (VAE):**\n\n    *   **Core Idea:** Clean the adversarial image by minimizing the difference between the original image and its reconstruction from a VAE.\n    *   **Objective Function:** Equation 7.3 is central: minimize the perturbation added to the original image, subject to the constraint that the perturbed image's reconstruction is close to the perturbed image itself.\n    *   **Variations Explored (CIFAR-10):** The document highlights that simple VAE purification (fixed iterations) doesn't work well on more complex datasets like CIFAR-10. Thus, it suggests several refinements:\n        *   Using the ADAM optimizer for the update step.\n        *   Variable learning rates based on the current reconstruction error.\n        *   Setting a target distribution for the reconstruction error. This is a critical improvement: instead of just minimizing the error, try to match a distribution characteristic of clean images.\n        *   Adding random noise or transformations at each update step. This is related to techniques like \"randomized smoothing\" to improve robustness.\n    *   **Counter-Attacks Considered:**  The document briefly considers counter-attacks against the VAE purifier, including modifying the loss function to account for the purification process.\n    *   **ImageNet Application:**  The VAE purifier combined with a noise-remover network trained in a self-supervised manner is used for ImageNet.  Different configurations, including random noise and transformations, are evaluated.\n    *   **Limitations:** The document acknowledges the need for larger perturbation values to mount a considerable attack.\n\n3.  **Distribution-Based Methods (General Trend):**\n\n    *   The paper discusses techniques that assume adversarial examples come from a different distribution than clean examples.\n    *   **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD):**  Detect adversaries by measuring the statistical difference between the distributions of adversaries and non-adversaries.\n\n4.  **Reverse Cross-Entropy (RCE):**\n\n    *   **Core Idea:** Train a classifier to *predict the incorrect* label.\n    *   **Benefits (claimed):** Improved adversarial detection and increased robustness.\n\n5.  **Features Distance Spaces and LSTM:**\n\n    *   **Core Idea:** Adversarial examples follow different paths through the layers of a neural network.\n    *   **Method:** Calculate the L2 distances from each layer to the M class mean vectors and send the N distance vectors through a sequential neural network (LSTM or MLP).\n    *   **Benefits:** LSTM yields better results than MLP due to sequential nature of patterns.\n\n6.  **Feature Squeezing:**\n    *   **Core Idea:** Comparing predictions of squeezed inputs and unsqueezed inputs. Reduces the dimensionality of the input.\n    *   **Method:** Color bit-depth reduction and spatial smoothing.\n\n**Methods (less directly applicable)**\n\n*   Early Statistical Methods such as using PCA or Softmax distribution.\n*   Network based methods\n\n**Important Considerations Regarding Currency:**\n\n*   **Focus on Older Techniques:** The bulk of the documented methods appear to predate late 2021. The value lies in the framework it presents and the comparisons it makes, but truly \"latest trends\" might not be fully represented.\n*   **Lack of Explicit Dates:** The paper's publication or writing date isn't present, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly how current the information is.\n\n**To get a more complete view of the *latest* trends:** You would need to supplement this information with more recent literature searches.  Specifically, focus on papers published in top-tier machine learning and security conferences in 2022-2024 covering:\n\n*   Adversarial training techniques\n*   Certified robustness (provable defenses)\n*   Diffusion models for adversarial defense or detection\n*   Adversarial robustness in large language models (LLMs)\n\nIn summary, this document provides a useful overview of adversarial detection methods, with a strong emphasis on CVAEs.  However, the lack of recent publication dates necessitates further research to determine if these techniques are still considered state-of-the-art and to identify the very latest trends in the field."

      "relevancy": "This paper introduces a lightweight and certifiable adversarial defense called \"robust width\" and empirically validates it on ImageNet against L^\\infty perturbations. It is relevant to the research question as it focuses on adversarial robustness for image classification and has been published in the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years.\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper presents a lightweight and certifiable adversarial defense method called \"Robust Width adversarial defense\". It leverages the Robust Width Property (RWP) from compressed sensing to create an input purification scheme.  The core idea is to denoise adversarial examples by exploiting the approximate sparsity of natural images in a chosen basis. This defense aims to improve robustness without adversarial training, large models, or massive datasets.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness, Last 2 Years):**\n\nThe paper directly addresses a key challenge in the field of adversarial robustness: developing defenses that are effective, efficient, and have theoretical guarantees.  Here's how it relates to current trends:\n\n1.  **Addressing Limitations of Current Defenses:**\n    *   The introduction explicitly discusses the limitations of adversarial training (AT) and randomized smoothing (RS), the two most popular defenses. AT is computationally expensive and lacks theoretical guarantees. RS, while enjoying theoretical guarantees, can be computationally expensive due to sampling, and relies on strong denoisers (often diffusion models), limiting its applicability in resource-constrained environments.\n    *   The paper identifies the problem that RS and Denoised Smoothing (DS) rely on large datasets and complex models (e.g., diffusion models), making them unsuitable for scenarios with limited data (e.g., medical imaging). This highlights a trend of research moving towards more efficient and data-independent methods.\n    *   The reference to Carlini et al. (2023) explicitly critiques the computational expense of denoised smoothing:  \"At this time, however, the reality is slightly more nuanced. First, DS can be computationally expensive due to the large number of samples that need to be taken to certify robustness with sufficient certainty.\"\n\n2.  **\"Plug-and-Play\" Defenses:**\n    *   The paper frames its approach as a \"plug-and-play\" defense, emphasizing that it can be applied to existing models without retraining or fine-tuning. This reflects a trend towards defenses that are easily integrated into existing systems.\n    *   The authors explicitly state: \"It therefore holds the promise of being an efficient \u201cplug-and-play\u201d adversarial defense [Carlini et al., 2023].\"\n\n3.  **Theoretical Guarantees:**\n    *   A major focus is on deriving novel robustness guarantees based on compressed sensing and the RWP. The authors aim to provide provable robustness, which is a critical area of research.\n    *   They contrast their approach with AT methods that \"tend to lack theoretical robustness guarantees.\"\n    *   Theorem 4.9 provides a probabilistic certification of the defense.\n\n4.  **Sparsity-Based Approaches:**\n    *   The paper explicitly connects to the line of research that explores the role of sparsity in adversarial robustness. Section 3 (\"Related Work\") is dedicated to this.\n    *   The authors position their work as an extension of Marzi et al. (2018), integrating more recent compressed sensing results.\n    *   They discuss and address potential issues like gradient masking, which is a concern with some sparsity-based defenses.\n\n5.  **Evaluation Methodology:**\n    *   The authors acknowledge and address the pitfalls in evaluating adaptive test-time defenses, as highlighted by Croce et al. (2022). This indicates an awareness of current best practices in the field. They explicitly perform experiments to rule out obfuscated gradients.\n    *   They use strong adversarial attacks (APGD, Square) and conduct transferability tests.\n\n6.  **Emphasis on Resource-Limited Environments:** The paper directly states that it is trying to \"improve adversarial robustness in resource-limited environments.\" This indicates a trend in research that is focusing on settings where large amounts of data and computational resources are not available.\n\n**Specific Method and Contributions (Relevant to Trends):**\n\n*   **RWP-Based Defense:** The core contribution is the use of the RWP to construct an adversarial denoiser. This is a novel way to approach the problem.\n*   **Lightweight Denoiser:** Replacing complex denoisers (e.g., diffusion models) with a lightweight algorithm that needs no training is a key differentiator.\n*   **Robustness Certificates:** The paper derives theoretical robustness certificates that depend on the sparsity of the data and the properties of the sensing operator.\n*   **Empirical Validation:** The method is empirically validated on ImageNet, a standard benchmark. It shows promising results, especially at larger perturbation budgets.\n* Code is available [at this URL.](https://github.com/peck94/robust-width-defense)\n\n**Key Citations (Indicative of Current Landscape):**\n\nThe paper cites recent and relevant works in the field:\n\n*   **Carlini et al. (2023):** Critique of Denoised Smoothing.\n*   **Croce et al. (2022):** Guidelines for evaluating adaptive test-time defenses.\n*   **Liu et al. (2023):**  Adversarially trained Swin Transformer, used as a benchmark.\n*   **Debenedetti et al. (2023):** XCiT-L12 model, used as a benchmark.\n*   **Peng et al.

(2022):** DiffPure, another adversarial purification method.\n*   **Qian et al., 2022:** Survey on adversarial training.\n\n**Limitations Acknowledged in the Paper (Reflecting Open Challenges):**\n\n*   The method requires a minimum level of robustness from the base classifier to begin with.\n*   It mentions the Fourier transform may be unsuitable for certain model architectures such as the Transformer.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper directly contributes to the recent trends in adversarial robustness research by offering a computationally efficient, data-independent defense with theoretical guarantees. It addresses the limitations of popular methods like adversarial training and randomized smoothing, focusing on resource-constrained scenarios. The paper's evaluation follows best practices, and its results are promising, particularly at larger perturbation budgets, making it a relevant contribution to the current state of the field."

      "relevancy": "This paper focuses on black-box targeted adversarial attacks on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), exploring the robustness of a foundation model in computer vision under adversarial conditions. It was published in 2023, so it falls within the last two years.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on adversarial robustness for image classification trends within the last 2 years, as of the paper's publication date:\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper**\n\n*   The paper primarily investigates targeted adversarial attacks (TAAs) on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model for computer vision.\n*   It aims to develop a *black-box* TAA, meaning the attacker has no access to the SAM's architecture, parameters, or internal states. This is in contrast to *white-box* attacks where the attacker has full knowledge.\n*   The research focuses on the *transferability* of adversarial examples generated on a surrogate model (SAM-B) to other SAM variants (SAM-L, SAM-H).\n* The paper was published in 2023, so it falls within the last 2 years.\n\n**Key Aspects Relevant to Adversarial Robustness Trends (Image Classification Context)**\n\nWhile the paper focuses on SAM (which is primarily a segmentation model), it draws upon and contributes to the broader field of adversarial robustness, including concepts applicable to image classification:\n\n1.  ***Black-Box Attacks and Transferability:**\n    *   **Trend:** The paper directly addresses the increasing interest in black-box attacks. Black-box attacks are more practical than white-box attacks because they don't require internal knowledge of the target model.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:** Black-box attack strategies developed for SAM can be adapted for attacking image classification models in scenarios where the model is a \"black box\".\n    *   **Key Finding:** The transferability of adversarial examples (i.e., their ability to fool different models) is a crucial element in black-box attacks. The paper emphasizes this by focusing on cross-model transferability (attacking SAM-B and transferring to SAM-L/H).\n\n2.  ***Targeted vs. Untargeted Attacks:**\n    *   **Trend:** The paper specifically focuses on *targeted* adversarial attacks.  This represents a trend toward more sophisticated attacks that aim to force the model to predict a specific, pre-selected target label (or, in SAM's case, generate a specific target mask).\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:** Targeted attacks are generally more challenging than untargeted attacks and highlight vulnerabilities in model decision boundaries. Successful targeted attacks show a deeper understanding of how to manipulate the model's output.\n\n3.  ***Adversarial Examples as Features:**\n    *   **Trend:** The paper references the concept (from Ilyas et al., 2019) that adversarial examples are not merely \"bugs\" but rather exploit *features* learned by the model. This understanding influences the attack strategy.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:**  This \"adversarial examples as features\" viewpoint has significant implications for defense strategies in image classification. Instead of treating adversarial examples as noise to be filtered out, defenses should aim to make the model less sensitive to these learned adversarial features.\n\n4.  ***Feature Dominance/Strength as a Factor:**\n    *   **Trend:** A key contribution is the identification of *relative feature strength* as a factor influencing cross-model transferability. The paper argues that adversarial examples with stronger, more dominant features are more likely to transfer successfully to other models.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:** This concept can be extended to image classification.  Generating adversarial examples that strongly activate particular features in the target model can improve transferability in black-box scenarios. The paper's proposed regularization loss aims to increase this feature dominance.\n\n5. ***Regularization Techniques***\n    *   **Trend:** The paper proposes a novel regularization loss (used in PATA++) to boost the feature dominance of adversarial examples and enhance cross-model transferability. This aligns with the broader trend of using regularization to improve the robustness and generalization of models in the face of adversarial attacks.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:** Regularization techniques have been widely used in adversarial training for image classification. The novel regularization loss proposed in this paper provides a new approach that can be explored in adversarial training algorithms for image classification models.\n\n**Specific Methods and Findings**\n\n*   **PATA (Prompt-Agnostic Target Attack):** A method developed to generate adversarial examples that are effective regardless of the prompt used with SAM. This is achieved by attacking the image encoder directly, rather than the prompt-guided mask decoder.\n*   **PATA++:** An enhanced version of PATA that incorporates a regularization loss to increase the \"feature dominance\" of adversarial examples.  This is achieved by using patches randomly cropped from the to-be-attacked clean image as the competition images.\n*   **Experimental Results:** The paper demonstrates that PATA++ achieves significantly better cross-model transferability than PATA alone (Table 2). It also shows that PATA++ is complementary with other state-of-the-art techniques like TI-FGSM (Translation-Invariant FGSM).\n* **Relevance to image classification robustness:** The adversarial training and regularization loss have shown improved adversarial robustness in image classification models.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions (Implied)**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges that cross-model TAA is a challenging task, suggesting that further research is needed to improve transferability.\n*   The decrease in cross-model transferability when using MI-FGSM (Momentum Iterative FGSM) is noted as a surprising finding that requires further investigation.\n\n**In summary:** This paper, while focusing on adversarial attacks against the Segment Anything Model, contributes to the broader understanding of adversarial robustness by: (1) Emphasizing black-box attacks and transferability. (2) Highlighting the importance of feature dominance in transferable adversarial examples. (3) Proposing a novel regularization technique to improve feature dominance and transferability. These insights and techniques are relevant to the ongoing research into adversarial robustness for image classification."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Toward Robust Image Classification\n\n**Key Areas & Trends (Based on the paper's content and publication dates of cited works):**\n\n1.  **Combination Defenses:** The most prominent trend highlighted is the use of combined defenses. This paper itself presents a combination defense strategy. The core idea is to leverage the strengths of multiple defense mechanisms to achieve better overall robustness.\n\n    *   **Bayesian Uncertainty with Preprocessing:**  The paper's specific approach combines Bayesian uncertainty estimation (using dropout) with image preprocessing techniques (cropping and resizing). The Bayesian uncertainty acts as an initial filter for potentially adversarial images. If the uncertainty is in a middle range, preprocessing is applied as a secondary check.\n    *  **Reasoning for Combination:** Using image preprocessing allows a lower uncertainty threshold (more aggressively flagging potential adversarial examples) since false positives will be corrected by the secondary preprocessing stage.\n\n2.  **Bayesian Uncertainty Based Defenses:** Using the uncertainty in deep neural networks to detect adversarial attacks.\n\n    *  **Dropout for Uncertainty Estimation:**  Using dropout during inference to generate multiple predictions and calculate the variance (uncertainty) of those predictions. Adversarial examples are expected to have higher uncertainty than clean examples due to the precise perturbations.\n    *   **Comparison to Feinman et al. [3]:** The paper compares its performance to Feinman et al. (2017), who also used Bayesian uncertainty (with dropout) but combined it with kernel density estimation instead of preprocessing.\n\n3.  **Image Preprocessing Defenses:**  Altering the input image to disrupt adversarial perturbations.\n\n    *   **Cropping and Resizing:** Specifically, the paper focuses on cropping and resizing as a preprocessing step. This technique aims to remove or weaken adversarial perturbations by focusing on different parts of the image.\n    *   **Comparison to Graese et al. [6] and Guo et al. [7]:** The paper cites Graese et al. (2016) and Guo et al. (2018) to highlight the use of cropping-resizing.\n\n4.  **Adversarial Detection as a Strategy:** Rather than solely focusing on making the classifier robust (i.e., correctly classifying adversarial examples), the paper emphasizes *detecting* adversarial examples.  Images flagged as adversarial are discarded, and classification accuracy is then evaluated on the remaining images.\n\n**Specific Techniques & Implementation Details from the Paper's Approach:**\n\n*   **Algorithm 1 (Adversarial Image Detection):**\n    *   Calculate image prediction and uncertainty.\n    *   If uncertainty is above a high threshold (H), declare the image adversarial.\n    *   If uncertainty is below a low threshold (L), declare the image clean.\n    *   If uncertainty is between L and H:\n        *   Crop and resize the image 5 times (top left, bottom left, top right, bottom right, center).\n        *   Reclassify each crop.\n        *   If a majority (more than C) of the crops are classified as the original class, declare the image clean; otherwise, declare it adversarial.\n*   **Neural Network Architecture:** LeNet convnet is used for the MNIST dataset, with dropout (rate of 0.5) after the last pooling layer and after the inner-product layer.\n*   **Adversarial Attacks Used for Evaluation:**  Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA).\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Detection accuracy (True Positives + True Negatives / Total Images) and classification accuracy on the images *not* flagged as adversarial.\n\n**Performance Highlights:**\n\n*   The combined defense achieved high adversarial image detection accuracy (96.1% - 98.3% on MNIST) across the three attack methods.\n*   Classification accuracy on the remaining (clean-flagged) images was very high (around 99%).\n*   The authors claim slightly greater adversarial example detection accuracy compared to other recent work (specifically Feinman et al. [3]) on the MNIST dataset.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work Suggested by the Authors:**\n\n*   Explore a combination method that involves binarization (referencing Graese et al. [6]).\n*   Investigate defenses against a broader range of attack methods.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question:**\n\nThe paper is highly relevant. It was published recently (assuming a publication date around 2019-2020, given the 2018 citations) and directly addresses adversarial robustness for image classification. It provides insights into the trends of combination defenses, Bayesian uncertainty, and image preprocessing, offering a detailed implementation and evaluation of a specific combined approach. The comparison with other recent works (Feinman et al., Graese et al., Wang et al., and Ma et al.) further strengthens its relevance.\n\n**In Summary (Answering the Research Question Directly):**\n\nBased on this paper, the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (within the last 2 years, as of the paper's writing) include:\n\n*   **Combining multiple defense mechanisms (Combination Defenses)** such as Bayesian uncertainty with image preprocessing, to leverage the strengths of each and achieve greater robustness.\n*   **Employing Bayesian uncertainty estimation** within neural networks (often using dropout during inference) as a way to detect adversarial examples.\n*   **Using image preprocessing techniques,** particularly cropping and resizing, to disrupt adversarial perturbations.\n*   **Focusing on adversarial detection** as a key strategy, discarding potentially adversarial images and evaluating classification accuracy on the remaining \"clean\" subset."

This means not just empirically demonstrating robustness against attacks, but providing theoretical guarantees about the model's behavior within a defined threat model (e.g., under specific types and magnitudes of adversarial perturbations).\n*   **Interval Bound Propagation:** Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) is a technique used for certified robustness, and the paper references works that use and improve upon IBP.\n*   **Smooth Regularization:**  The paper introduces the idea of \"smooth regularization\" as a way to improve certified robustness.

However, the paper also experiments with image classification tasks to demonstrate the broader applicability of the method.\n*   **BTN Components:** The BTN consists of:\n    *   A Base Model (e.g., MCNN for crowd counting).\n    *   A Smooth Regularization Module (using layer weights to guide learning).\n    *   A Certify Bound Module (propagating interval bounds through the network).\n*   **Loss Function:** A custom loss function is used, combining:\n    *   Normal training loss (e.g., Mean Squared Error).\n    *   Certify error loss (measuring the violation of robustness bounds).\n    *   Regularization loss (based on L1 or L2 norms of layer weights).\n*   **Multi-Stage Training:** A multi-stage training schedule is used to warm up the model, slowly decrease a weighting factor (\u03ba) and then performs certificate training.\n\n**Experiments and Results (with relevance to Image Classification):**\n\n*   **CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet:**  The paper includes ablation studies on the CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of BTN for image classification. This shows the transferability of the BTN concept beyond just crowd counting.\n*   **Comparison to IBP and CROWN-IBP:** The BTN is compared to Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) and CROWN-IBP (a more advanced variant) in terms of standard error and verified error. BTN achieves comparable or better results.\n*   **L\u221e and L2 Norms:** Robustness is evaluated under both L\u221e and L2 norm bounded perturbations.\n*   **Ablation studies:** Ablation studies are performed to demonstrate that the smooth regularization module in BTN helps improve the model's performance against adversarial examples.\n\n**Cited Papers (published within the last two years, relevant to Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   **Wan and Chan, \"Modeling noisy annotations for crowd counting,\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 33, 2020.** Although related to crowd counting, this paper appeared in NeurIPS, a major ML conference, suggesting relevance to the broader field.\n*   **Sungyoon Lee, Jaewook Lee, and Saerom Park, \"Lipschitz-certifiable training with a tight outer bound,\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 33, 2020.** This paper focuses on Lipschitz-certifiable training which provides a way to formally verify the robustness of a neural network.\n*   **Qiming Wu, Zhikang Zou, Pan Zhou, Xiaoqing Ye, Binghui Wang, and Ang Li, \u201cTowards adversarial patch analysis and certified defense against crowd counting,\u201d in Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2021, pp. 2195\u20132204.** This paper is from the same author as the main document.\n*   **Shunchang Liu, Jiakai Wang, Aishan Liu, Yingwei Li, Yijie Gao, Xianglong Liu, and Dacheng Tao, \u201cHarnessing perceptual adversarial patches for crowd counting,\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.07986, 2021.** Focuses on adversarial patches.\n\n**Key Takeaways and Trends (in the context of the research question):**\n\n1.  **Certified Robustness is Growing:**  There's a clear trend towards methods that provide *certified* robustness guarantees, rather than just empirical evaluations.\n\n2.  **IBP and its Improvements:** Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) is a key technique, with ongoing research focused on improving its tightness and efficiency (as evidenced by the comparison to CROWN-IBP).\n\n3.  **Regularization for Robustness:** Regularization techniques, especially those tailored to the specific certification method, are seen as crucial for achieving good certified robustness without sacrificing clean accuracy. The BTN paper emphasizes \"smooth regularization.\"\n\n4.  **Transferability of Techniques:** While this paper focuses on crowd counting, the application of BTN to image classification datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet highlights the potential transferability of robustness techniques across different tasks.\n\n5.  **Continued Focus on Lp Norms:**  Lp norm bounded perturbations remain a standard way to define the threat model, allowing for quantitative comparisons between different defense methods.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper contributes to the trend of developing certified defenses against adversarial attacks. It proposes a novel method (BTN) that combines interval bound propagation with a smooth regularization technique, achieving promising results on both crowd counting and image classification tasks.

      "summary": "Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the paper to answer your research question about the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on the last two years.\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper focuses on *certifying* distributional robustness, particularly *out-of-domain generalization*, for image classification tasks, *not adversarial robustness* in the traditional sense of crafting adversarial examples to fool classifiers. The authors propose a framework to bound the *worst-case population risk* when the data distribution shifts, using the Hellinger distance to measure the shift.\n\n**Why this is NOT directly related to Adversarial Robustness (although tangentially)**\n\n*   **Distributional Shift vs. Adversarial Perturbation:** The paper deals with a shift in the *entire* data distribution (e.g., different lighting conditions, a change in the proportions of classes). Adversarial robustness deals with small, often imperceptible, perturbations to *individual* input images designed to cause misclassification.\n*   **Certification vs. Defense:** The paper provides *certificates* \u2013 guarantees on the model's performance within a certain distribution shift bound. It is *not* a method for training a model that is inherently robust to adversarial examples (although the authors do relate the problem to variance regularization).\n\n**Despite this, here's how the paper *relates* to your query (and why it might be of interest):**\n\n1.  **General Concept of Robustness:** Both adversarial robustness and distributional robustness are concerned with a model's ability to perform reliably under changed input conditions.\n2.  **Certification:** Certifying robustness (either adversarial or distributional) is a *trend* in the broader field.\n\n**Key Aspects Relevant to Broader Robustness Trends (and within the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Emphasis on Certification (Trend):** The very *title* and the core contribution are about *certifying* robustness. This signifies a move in the field towards providing provable guarantees about model behavior, rather than just empirical demonstrations of robustness.\n*   **Scalability to Large Datasets and Models (Trend):** The paper emphasizes its method's ability to scale to ImageNet-scale datasets and complex models like EfficientNet-B7. A major limitation of many previous certification techniques was their inability to handle realistic, large-scale problems.\n*   **Blackbox Approach (Trend):**  The method treats the model as a blackbox, requiring minimal assumptions about the model's architecture or internal workings.  This is practically advantageous as it can be applied to a wider range of models.\n*   **Distributional Robustness as a Form of Robustness (Expanding Scope):** While not *adversarial* robustness, the work highlights the increasing importance of considering robustness to *distribution shifts*. The introduction explicitly mentions the real-world challenges of models failing when deployed in environments different from their training data. This broader notion of robustness is becoming more prevalent.\n*   **Connection to Variance Regularization (Indirect Defense Strategy):** The paper notes that minimizing a variance-regularized objective effectively minimizes an upper bound on the worst-case risk.  This connects to a trend of using regularization techniques to improve robustness *indirectly*.\n\n**Specific Details from the Paper:**\n\n*   **Problem Addressed:** Certifying the robustness of model performance under bounded data distribution drifts for blackbox models and bounded loss functions.\n*   **Proposed Solution:** A novel certification framework based on the Hellinger distance.\n*   **Key Innovation:** An algorithmic framework that arises from bounding inner products between elements of a suitable Hilbert space.\n*   **Certificate Form:** The paper provides a certificate in the following form:\n\n    \n    \u2200Q : dist(Q, P ) \u2264 \u03c1\n    =\u21d2 E(X,Y )\u223cQ[\u2113(h(X), Y )] \u2264 C\u2113(\u03c1, P )\n    \n\n    Where *Q* is a shifted distribution, *P* is the in-domain distribution, *dist(Q, P)* is the Hellinger distance, *\u03c1* is the distance bound, *\u2113* is the loss function, *h* is the classifier, and *C\u2113* is a bound that depends on the distance and the in-domain distribution.\n\n*   **Distribution Shift Models Considered:**\n    *   Label distribution shifts\n    *   Covariate distribution shifts\n*   **Loss Functions Considered:**\n    *   JSD loss\n    *   0-1 loss (classification error)\n    *   AUC\n\n**Experimental Results:**\n\n*   The method scales to ImageNet and models like EfficientNet-B7.\n*   The method provides tighter certificates compared to state-of-the-art methods on smaller-scale datasets.\n*   Experiments include:\n    *   Distributional robustness certificates for generic distribution shifts on vision and NLP datasets for JSD and 0-1 loss.\n    *   Distributional robustness certificates for AUC against generic distribution shifts on binary ImageNet and CIFAR datasets.\n    *   Certified Generalization for label distribution shifts on CIFAR-10 and Yelp datasets.\n    *   Certificate against covariate shift on colored MNIST.\n\n**Comparison to Other Methods (and Why It's a Trend):**\n\nThe authors explicitly contrast their method with techniques that rely on:\n\n*   Bounded Lipschitz gradients of both the model and loss function\n*   Expensive minimax optimization\n\nThey argue that these techniques are not scalable to large-scale datasets and complex models. The paper directly compares against Wasserstein-based certificates from Sinha et al. (2018) and Cranko et al. (2021) and shows that their method provides tighter certificates while being agnostic to the model architecture.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   The paper assumes that the loss function is bounded.\n*   Estimating f-divergences (especially the Hellinger distance) from data can be difficult in practice.\n*   The certificate can be conservative (i.e., provide a looser bound than the true robustness) due to considering a broader class of distribution shifts than might be present in specific scenarios.\n\n**Why this is Relevant (Even Though Not Direct Adversarial Robustness):**\n\nThe work represents a trend in the field towards:\n\n*   **Provable guarantees:** Providing *certificates* of robustness.\n*   **Scalability:** Developing methods that can handle realistic image classification problems.\n*   **Flexibility:**  Working with blackbox models and non-smooth loss functions.\n*   **Broader notions of robustness:** Considering robustness beyond just adversarial examples.\n\n**In conclusion:** While this paper doesn't directly address *adversarial* robustness, it reflects key trends in the broader field of robustness for image classification, namely a move towards scalable certification techniques that can handle large models and datasets and make minimal assumptions about the model and a growing interest in robustness to distributional shift as a complementary problem to adversarial robustness."

It focuses on advancements in UAPs, categorizes them, and evaluates their effectiveness, including defense mechanisms.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the paper, specifically focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, with emphasis on developments within the last two years (approximately since June 2021, given the submission date of June 2023).  I'll highlight the most pertinent sections and provide a structured summary.\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper is a survey focusing on Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) in image classification. It categorizes UAPs into noise-based and generator-based attacks.  It evaluates different loss functions used for learning UAPs and investigates the impact of training data, model architecture, and defense mechanisms.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness for Image Classification - Last 2 Years):**\n\nWhile this paper is primarily a *survey* and not original research, it provides a valuable overview of recent techniques and trends, especially concerning the *evaluation* of adversarial robustness. The most useful parts are the experimental sections and the references to recent papers.  I will focus on studies that the paper mentions which were published in the last two years.\n\n**Key Areas and Specific Findings Related to Recent Trends:**\n\n1.  **Categorization of UAP Methods:**\n    *   The survey categorizes UAPs into two main groups:\n        *   **Noise-based methods:** Directly optimize the UAP by updating the perturbation itself. Examples include PD-UAP [32] (ICCV 2019), F-UAP [24] (CVPR 2020), and Jigsaw-UAP [25] (ICCV 2021).\n        *   **Generator-based methods:**  Train a UAP generation network (often GAN-based) to produce the perturbation. Examples include TTP [27] (ICCV 2021).\n\n2.  **Data-Free Approaches:**\n    *   The paper highlights a trend towards methods that *don't* require original training data. This is important because access to the original training data (e.g., ImageNet) is often limited in real-world scenarios.\n    *   Methods in this category use proxy data (e.g., MS COCO), artificial data, or *no* data to learn the UAP.  Examples: FFF [21] (BMVC 2017), GD-UAP [31] (TPAMI 2018), and Jigsaw-UAP [25] (ICCV 2021) which use proxy data, artificial data, or even no data.\n    *   AAA [36] (ECCV 2018) also generates proxy samples using the target model itself.\n\n3.  **Targeted Attacks and Transferability:**\n    *   The paper discusses methods that focus on *targeted* attacks, where the goal is to misclassify an image into a *specific* class. Examples include CD-UAP [30] (AAAI 2020), F-UAP [24] (CVPR 2020), and TTP [27] (ICCV 2021).\n    *   A key focus is on the *transferability* of UAPs, meaning their ability to fool *different* (black-box) models than the one they were trained on.\n    *   The GM-TUAP [34] (Arxiv-2020) argues that increasing the adversarial energy in the first layer from a target model can improve the transferability.\n    *   TTP [27] (ICCV 2021) focuses on transferable targeted attacks, leveraging a matching distribution loss for training and minimizing the label distribution between adversarial samples of a proxy dataset and the original training source dataset.\n\n4.  **Loss Functions:**\n    *   The paper emphasizes the importance of the loss function used to train UAPs.  It categorizes loss functions into:\n        *   Feature-based (e.g., FFF)\n        *   Similarity-based (e.g., Cosine similarity)\n        *   Entropy-based (e.g., Cross-entropy, Relative Cross-entropy)\n        *   Margin-based (e.g., C&W)\n    *   The paper conducts experiments to compare the performance of these loss functions under consistent training settings.\n        *   The simplest similarity-based Lcos achieves the overall highest fooling rate under different training frameworks in non-targeted attacks.\n        *   The margin-based loss consistently achieves a higher success rate for both targeted and non-targeted attacks.\n        *   Different cross-entropy-based loss functions used in the targeted attack have similar performance.\n\n5.  **Defense Mechanisms:**\n    *   The paper evaluates the robustness of models against UAPs by testing against various defense mechanisms. The paper focuses on two types of defense mechanisms: Input transformation and Robust Training.\n    *   Input transformation: Neural representation purifier (NRP) [46] (CVPR 2020).\n    *   Robust training: augmentation-based training (Augmix [47]), stylization-based training (SIN [48] and SIN-IN [48]), and adversarial training [49].\n    *   A key finding is that adversarial training (specifically, training with adversarial examples generated using an l-infinity norm constraint) provides better robustness against UAPs than other defenses tested.\n    *   Adversarially trained CNNs based on the l\u221e-trained adversarial samples show better robustness for defending against various types of UAPs.\n    *   By comparing these defense mechanisms, adversarial training can achieve lower fooling rates, which is superior to others.\n\n6.  **Model Architecture:**\n    *   The paper finds that GoogleNet (with inception modules) is relatively harder to attack with UAPs compared to VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet architectures.\n    *   Compared with the VGG [38], ResNet [39], DenseNet [2] based network architecture, attacking the GoogleNet [1] with inception modules is with the relatively lower transfer fooling rate for both non-targeted and targeted attacks. This observation highlights the need to design robust models using the inception module proposed in GoogleNet.\n\n**Specific Papers Mentioned Published in the Last 2 Years (June 2021 - Present, Based on Survey Content):**\n\n*   **[13] Z.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided paper, focusing on extracting information relevant to the research question:  \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**High-Level Summary of the Paper**\n\nThe paper focuses on generating universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) for remote sensing images (RSIs). It introduces a method combining an encoder-decoder network and an attention mechanism (saliency map) to create these UAPs. The goal is to fool RSI classification models, achieving a high attack success rate (ASR) with minimal perturbation.  The paper also investigates attack selectivity (where adversarial examples are often misclassified into a small subset of classes).\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends in Adversarial Robustness)**\n\nThis paper contributes to the field of adversarial robustness by:\n\n1.  **Expanding Adversarial Attack Research to RSIs:**  The paper explicitly addresses the gap in UAP research for RSIs, as most work focuses on ordinary images. This highlights a trend of applying adversarial attack and defense techniques to more specialized image domains like remote sensing.\n\n2.  **Investigating UAPs:** The use of Universal Adversarial Perturbations is itself a trend in adversarial attacks.  UAPs are more practical than single-image adversarial examples because they are image-agnostic and can be used to attack multiple images.\n\n3.  **Encoder-Decoder Networks for UAP Generation:** The paper proposes using encoder-decoder networks to generate UAPs. This suggests a trend of leveraging generative models to craft more effective and efficient adversarial examples. The encoder-decoder structure helps in learning the distribution of perturbations.\n\n4.  **Attention Mechanisms/Saliency Maps:** The integration of a saliency map to fine-tune the perturbation is significant. This indicates a trend towards incorporating attention mechanisms to target the most sensitive regions of an image for attack. By focusing on these sensitive areas, the magnitude of the required perturbation can be reduced, improving the imperceptibility of the attack.\n\n5.  **Attack Selectivity Analysis:** The paper investigates and confirms the existence of attack selectivity in RSIs, meaning that adversarial examples tend to be misclassified into a few specific classes. Understanding attack selectivity is crucial for developing more targeted defenses.\n\n**Specific Details and Evidence from the Paper**\n\n*   **Problem Addressed:** \"The research on UAP is mostly limited to ordinary images, and RSIs have not been studied.\"  This establishes the novelty and relevance of the paper.\n*   **Proposed Method:**  \"This paper proposes a novel method combining an encoder-decoder network with an attention mechanism to generate the UAP of RSIs.\" This is the core contribution.\n*   **Encoder-Decoder Network:** \"Firstly, the former is used to generate the UAP, which can learn the distribution of perturbations better...\"  This explains the rationale for using an encoder-decoder.\n*   **Attention Mechanism (Saliency Map):** \"...and then the latter is used to find the sensitive regions concerned by the RSI classification model. Finally, the generated regions are used to fine-tune the perturbation making the model misclassified with fewer perturbations.\"  This describes the role of the saliency map.\n*   **Experimental Results:** \"The experimental results show that the UAP can make the classification model misclassify, and the attack success rate of our proposed method on the RSI data set is as high as 97.09%.\"  This quantifies the effectiveness of the approach.\n*   **Generalization Ability:** \"As in Table III, our proposed method preserves a good ASR between different models. Such as, the UAP generated by VGG16 can achieve an ASR of over 90% on VGG19 and over 85% on ResNet34 and ResNet101.\" Shows the transferability of the generated UAPs.\n*   **Attack Selectivity Evidence:** \"For example, on the VGG19 model, over 88% of the validation set, which includes 38 classes, is misclassified into three classes.\" This confirms the attack selectivity phenomenon.\n*   **Relevant Citations:** The paper cites several relevant papers, some of which fall within the last two years, indicating current research trends.

While the scope is limited to a smaller dataset and network, the study of UAPs makes it relevant.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information concerning recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically focusing on papers published within the last 2 years (from the paper's perspective). Please note that the \"last 2 years\" is relative to the publication date of this specific paper, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be sometime after 2017 (since it references a 2017 CVPR paper). Therefore, consider the \"last 2 years\" to mean roughly 2016-2017.\n\n**Focus of the Paper**\n\nThe paper is primarily a reproduction and extension of the \"Universal Adversarial Perturbations\" paper by Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (CVPR 2017). It does not present novel adversarial robustness techniques *per se*, but rather investigates the efficiency of existing universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) methods on a smaller dataset and network architecture.  It primarily seeks to understand the behavior and characteristics of UAPs, and how they transfer between different network architectures.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Trends in Adversarial Robustness)**\n\nAlthough this paper doesn't directly introduce new *defenses* or *robustness* techniques, it sheds light on the *vulnerability* of image classification models to adversarial attacks, which is a crucial aspect of adversarial robustness research. By exploring the properties of UAPs, it implicitly contributes to understanding the limitations of current models and highlighting directions for developing more robust systems.  The key trends it touches upon (through its reproduction of the original UAP paper) relate to:\n\n1.  **The Existence and Transferability of Universal Adversarial Perturbations:** The central finding, originally presented by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., is that a single, image-agnostic perturbation (UAP) can fool a neural network with high probability across a wide range of images. This paper confirms the existence and explores the efficiency of UAPs. Furthermore, it demonstrates a degree of transferability of UAPs *between* different network architectures (VGG-11 vs. VGG-16/VGG-19), indicating that vulnerabilities are not necessarily specific to a single model. The results section comparing the UAP generated for VGG-11 with UAPs from VGG-16 and VGG-19 highlights this transferability trend, even though the networks were trained on different datasets. The comparable fooling rates suggest that UAPs exploit general vulnerabilities present in different network architectures.\n\n2.  **Geometric Properties of Decision Boundaries:** The paper discusses the idea that UAPs exploit geometric correlations between different parts of the decision boundary of the classifier. This suggests a trend in adversarial robustness research towards understanding the geometry of the high-dimensional feature spaces learned by neural networks and how these geometries can be manipulated by adversaries. The reference to \"dominant labels\" further reinforces this, as it suggests that certain regions of the image space are more susceptible to adversarial attacks.\n\n**Specific Findings and Observations**\n\n*   **UAP Computation on a Smaller Dataset:** The author successfully reproduced the UAP phenomenon on the VOC2012 dataset using the VGG-11 architecture.  They observed that a lower fooling rate was achieved compared to the original paper, which they attributed to the smaller size of the VOC2012 dataset.\n*   **Dominant Labels:** The author visualized the label transformations caused by the UAP using a directed graph. This visualization revealed the existence of \"dominant labels,\" which are labels that the network is frequently fooled into predicting. The paper suggests that these dominant labels occupy large regions in the image space, making them effective targets for adversarial attacks.\n*   **Comparison with Random Perturbations:** The author compared the effectiveness of the computed UAP to a random perturbation. The UAP was significantly more efficient at fooling the network than the random perturbation, demonstrating that UAPs exploit specific vulnerabilities in the network rather than simply adding noise.\n*   **Transferability Suggestion:** The author suggests modifying the UAP algorithm to use pre-calculated vectors (UAPs from other architectures) as input, instead of a null vector. The author claims this would speed up the process and increase the fooling rate scores. This is a transfer learning technique applied to UAPs.\n\n**Limitations and Context**\n\n*   **Limited Scope:** The paper focuses almost exclusively on UAPs as a *threat* to image classification. It doesn't delve into specific *defense* mechanisms or other aspects of adversarial robustness that might have been trending during the specified period.\n*   **Reproducibility Focus:** The paper's primary goal is reproducibility, meaning it doesn't necessarily push the boundaries of adversarial robustness research.\n*   **Dated Perspective:** The paper references work up to 2017. While it provides a snapshot of trends *leading up* to that point, it won't capture more recent developments in the field (post-2017).\n\n**In Summary**\n\nWithin the context of the research question, this paper (and the work it reproduces) contributes to the understanding of adversarial robustness by:\n\n*   Demonstrating the existence and transferability of universal adversarial perturbations, which pose a significant threat to image classification models.\n*   Highlighting the importance of understanding the geometric properties of decision boundaries in neural networks.\n\nWhile the paper itself doesn't present new *robustness* techniques, it reinforces the need for such techniques by showcasing the vulnerability of even relatively simple networks to carefully crafted adversarial attacks. The trends it touches upon point toward the importance of understanding network vulnerabilities, decision boundary geometry, and transferability of attacks, all of which are critical for developing more robust image classification systems. The comparison of the UAP to random perturbations shows how adversarial attacks are not just random noise, but rather an expliotion of the inner workings of neural networks."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the most relevant information from the paper, specifically addressing the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Summary of Relevant Content**\n\nThis paper *primarily* focuses on the robustness of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) for *skeleton-based action recognition*, **not image classification**. It uses Fourier analysis to understand how adversarial training affects the robustness of GCNs against adversarial attacks and common corruptions. However, it DOES reference recent trends in **CNN-based image classification** regarding adversarial robustness, which is where the relevant info lies.\n\n**Key Findings and Trends (as Referenced in the Paper regarding Image Classification):**\n\n*   **Fourier Analysis for Understanding Robustness:**\n    *   The paper highlights the use of Fourier analysis as a prominent trend in understanding the robustness of CNNs for image classification.\n    *   Specifically, it mentions that analyzing the frequency components of images and how CNNs respond to different frequencies has become a key technique.\n    *   This involves examining the Fourier spectrum of adversarial perturbations and common corruptions to see which frequencies CNNs are most vulnerable to.\n\n*   **Trade-off Between High and Low-Frequency Robustness:**\n    *   A major finding in image classification (using CNNs) is the existence of a trade-off: Adversarial training often makes CNNs more robust to high-frequency perturbations (e.g., Gaussian noise) but *more vulnerable* to low-frequency perturbations (e.g., fog, blur).\n    *   The paper cites research that leverages this trade-off to improve robustness by combining models specialized in handling different frequency ranges.\n\n*   **Frequency Bias and Generalization:**\n    *   Research suggests that CNNs tend to initially capture low-frequency components of images, but that standard-trained CNNs are heavily reliant on High-Frequency information\n    *   Also, models that ignore or downweight high-frequency components can be more robust (but might sacrifice some accuracy on clean images). This connects to the idea that high-frequency components might represent domain-specific features, while low-frequency components represent domain-invariant features (relevant for domain generalization).\n\n*   **Identifying Harmful Frequencies:**\n    *   Some studies have focused on identifying specific frequency ranges that are particularly harmful to CNN robustness against common corruptions. The goal is to develop methods to ignore or filter out these harmful frequencies.\n\n**Specific Citations & Their Relevance:**\n\nThe paper directly cites the following papers as relevant to the trends in image classification:\n\n*   **[16] Zhi-Qin John Xu, et al.

Only consider papers from the last 2 years\" and only considering papers from the last 2 years:\n\n**I.  Overall Focus and Claims of the Paper (Relevance to the Question)**\n\n*   **Class-wise Robustness is Critical:**  The central argument is that most adversarial robustness research focuses on *overall* model robustness, *disregarding class-wise differences*.  The paper claims this is a significant oversight because attackers can exploit weakly robust classes.\n*   **Class False Positive Score (CFPS):** The paper introduces and advocates for the use of the CFPS metric as a method for fairly evaluating the class-wise susceptibility to misclassification.\n*   **Identifies Vulnerable Classes:**  The paper aims to identify which classes are more vulnerable to misclassification and adversarial attacks.\n*   **Class biases in model accuracy:** The paper argues for a fair training process that allows classifying all classes about equally well.\n\n**II. Key Concepts and Methods Discussed**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:** The paper acknowledges adversarial training as a prominent defense technique. It notes that previous work has analyzed it from perspectives like robust optimization, generalization, training strategy, and architecture.\n*   **Class-wise Accuracy (CWA):**  The paper discusses CWA as a commonly used metric in prior works, but argues that it's insufficient on its own. The paper defines CWA as:\n    `CWA(cj) = |{xi|f\u03b8(xi) = cj, yi = cj}|/N + |{xi|f\u03b8(xi) \u0338= cj, yi \u0338= cj}|/N`\n*   **Class False Positive Score (CFPS):** The paper introduces and defines the CFPS as a critical metric:\n    `CFPS(cj) = |{xi|f\u03b8(xi) = cj, yi \u0338= cj}| / (total number of misclassifications)`\n    *   A *higher CFPS* indicates a class is *more susceptible* to being mistakenly assigned samples from other classes.\n*   **Common Corruptions:**  The paper explores robustness against common image corruptions (blurring, noise, etc.) using the CIFAR10-C dataset.\n*   **PGD Attack:** The paper uses the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack to evaluate adversarial robustness.\n\n**III. Experimental Setup and Results**\n\n*   **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 is used as the primary dataset.  CIFAR-10C (corrupted CIFAR-10) is used to test robustness against common corruptions.\n*   **Models:**  The paper evaluates several adversarially trained robust models, including:\n    *   ResNet-18\n    *   ResNet-50\n    *   DenseNet-169\n    *   PreActResNet-18\n    *   WideResNet-70-16\n    *   DINOv2 (a recent foundation model)\n*   **Weak Classes:** Experiments revealed that classes C3, C5, and C6, corresponding to \u2019bird\u2019, \u2019deer\u2019, and \u2019dog\u2019 respectively, fall into the category of weak classes, and consistently exhibit the lowest robust classification accuracy even with the inclusion of common corruptions\n*   **Vulnerable Classes:** Experiments revealed that classes C1, and C4 are comparatively higher, indicating these classes are highly susceptible to misclassifications.\n*   **Attack Vulnerability:** Experiments revealed the class C5 (deer) exhibits the lowest number of correct classifications, implying its vulnerability after subjecting the models to an adversarial attack, while class C4 (cat) indicating that a significant portion of other classes is being misclassified as this class.\n*   **Target Attack Success:** Experiments revealed that the \u201ccat\u201d class is more vulnerable to targeted attacks than the \u201cdeer\u201d class.\n\n**IV.  Specific Findings and Trends Highlighted (Directly Answering the Question)**\n\nBased on the experiments and analysis, the paper suggests these trends in adversarial robustness (with a class-wise perspective):\n\n1.  **Class-wise vulnerability disparities:** Not all classes are equally robust to adversarial attacks. Focusing solely on overall accuracy hides these disparities. Some classes consistently exhibit lower accuracy than others.\n2.  **Class vulnerability remains constant after the addition of common corruptions but the magnitude of vulnerability varies:** Weak classes still consistently exhibit the lowest robust classification accuracy even with the inclusion of common corruptions, while highly misclassified classes still maintains the highest CFPS.\n3.  **Importance of CFPS:** CFPS provides a different perspective than standard accuracy. A class might have low accuracy but *not* be a common target for misclassification, or vice-versa.  Classes with high CFPS are more likely to be the target of successful targeted attacks.\n4.  **Targeted attacks show different vulnerabilities:** A class that is easily confused *with other classes* (high CFPS) is more vulnerable to targeted attacks than a class that simply has low accuracy.\n\n**V.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Please note:** While the paper itself is likely from 2024 or 2023 (given the citations), the specific \"latest trends\" are garnered from the **related work** section and cited papers.  The specific date of each trend/method is listed to confirm recency.\n\n**I. Trends in Adversarial Robustness (from Related Work):**\n\n*   **Evaluating Robustness Across Diverse Architectures:** A trend involves thoroughly evaluating adversarial robustness across different adversarially trained model architectures (\\[8, 16] - both cited in the paper, indicating research in recent years leading up to the paper's publication). The paper specifically cites RobustBench (Croce et al., 2021 \\[8]) as a key resource for this trend.\n*   **Unifying Architectural Design and Robustness:**  Another trend focuses on unifying research efforts concerning architectural design choices and their impact on robustness (\\[21]). This suggests a move toward understanding *why* certain architectures are more robust than others.\n*   **Advancements Across Tasks:** Efforts are underway to improve adversarial robustness across various image processing tasks, including image classification, restoration, and segmentation. This involves enhancing or redesigning robust architectures (\\[1, 2, 17, 18, 21, 28]).  Specifically:\n    *   Agnihotri et al. (2023) \\[1] worked on image restoration, identifying vulnerabilities in transformers.\n    *   Agnihotri et al. (2025) \\[2] focuses on improving feature stability during upsampling, which is relevant to various image processing tasks.\n    *   Jovita Lukasik, Paul Gavrikov, Janis Keuper, and Margret Keuper (2023) \\[28\\] work on improving native CNN robustness with filter frequency regularization\n\n*   **Addressing Class-Wise Robustness Variations:** Despite overall robustness improvements, consistent variations in robustness across specific classes are observed.  This highlights the need for uniformly robust performance across all categories.\n*   **Focus on Adversarial Fairness:** A growing concern is adversarial fairness, where models favor specific classes over others after adversarial training.  This includes research into class biases in terms of model accuracy and robustness (\\[32, 41, 46, 47]).\n    *   Several methods have emerged to address unfairness:\n        *   **Fair Robust Learning (FRL)** (Xu et al., 2021 \\[47]): Adjusts perturbation margins and class weights based on fairness constraints.\n        *   **Balanced Adversarial Training (BAT)** (Sun et al., 2023 \\[40]): Aims to balance fairness between source and target classes.\n        *   **Class-wise Calibrated Fair Adversarial Training (CFA)** (Wei et al., 2023 \\[46]): Dynamically customizes adversarial configurations for different classes and modifies weight averaging techniques.\n        *   **Worst Class Adversarial Training (WAT)** (Li and Liu, 2023 \\[27]): Uses a no-regret dynamic algorithm to improve worst-class accuracy.\n        *   **DAFA** (Lee et al., 2024 \\[26]): Considers class similarity and assigns distinct adversarial margins and loss weights to each class.\n*   **Adversarial Training as a Defense:** Adversarial training (AT) remains a primary defense mechanism, where models are trained on adversarial examples (\\[5, 14, 31, 49]). The paper notes that early stopping \\[39] and the addition of external data \\[15, 38, 45] can help address overfitting to specific attacks used during training.\n*   **Analysis of AT from Different Perspectives:** Prior work analyzes AT from perspectives like robust optimization \\[44], robust generalization \\[37], and diverse training strategies \\[36, 44, 52].\n\n**II. Key Methods and Techniques Mentioned (Relevant to Recent Trends):**\n\n*   **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)** (Goodfellow et al., 2015 \\[14]): Used for generating adversarial examples during AT.\n*   **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)** (Madry et al., 2018 \\[31]): Another common method for generating adversarial examples.\n*   **AutoAttack** (Croce and Hein, 2020 \\[9]):  An ensemble of attacks used for robust evaluation.\n*   **Square Attack** (Andriushchenko et al., 2020 \\[4]):  A query-efficient black-box adversarial attack.\n*   **TRADES** (Zhang et al., 2019 \\[51]): A method aiming for a theoretically principled trade-off between robustness and accuracy.\n*   **FAT** (Zhang et al., 2020 \\[53]):  Attacks which do not kill training make adversarial learning stronger\n*   **EMA (Exponential Moving Average):** Weight averaging technique.\n*   **Fairness Aware Weight Average (FAWA):** Weight averaging technique as in CFA \\[46\\].\n\n**III. Challenges and Open Questions (Inherent to the Trends):**\n\n*   **Trade-off Between Robustness and Accuracy:**  Adversarial training often reduces accuracy on clean samples while improving robustness. The paper mentions an accuracy gap between clean and perturbed samples (\\[42, 43, 48, 51]).\n*   **Class-Wise Fairness Discrepancies:** AT can exacerbate imbalances in class-wise robustness, making \"hard\" classes more vulnerable.\n*   **Overfitting to Training Attacks:**  Adversarial training can lead to overfitting to the specific attacks used during training.\n*   **Maintaining Fairness Under Diverse Threats:** Models may struggle to maintain robustness and fairness when faced with diverse adversarial threats or common corruptions.\n\n**IV. Contributions of the FAIR-TAT Paper (In Relation to Trends):**\n\n*   The paper itself proposes **Fair Targeted Adversarial Training (FAIR-TAT)**, which focuses on targeted adversaries to improve fairness. This is a specific instantiation of the trend toward addressing class-wise robustness and fairness.  The core idea is to target vulnerable classes more often during training by generating more targeted adversaries toward those classes.\n*   FAIR-TAT uses **class-wise false positive scores (CFPS)** to model a prior distribution and sample target classes for adversarial training, aiming to improve the model's understanding of semantic differences and improve fairness.\n*   The paper examines class-specific vulnerabilities by analyzing class-wise false positives in adversarially trained models.\n\n**In summary, recent trends emphasize not just overall robustness against adversarial attacks, but also fairness across different classes, transferability to unseen attacks, and robustness to common corruptions. The FAIR-TAT paper contributes to these trends by proposing a targeted adversarial training framework that dynamically adjusts the training configuration based on class-specific confusion rates.**"

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper**\n\nThe paper primarily introduces a novel framework for generating adversarial benchmarks. While it isn't *directly* focused on *new* adversarial robustness techniques, it benchmarks *existing* state-of-the-art robustness methods and *indirectly* discusses recent trends by referencing and comparing against them. The paper itself was published in 2023, making its references potentially relevant for the 2-year window.\n\n**Directly Relevant Information (Trends & Techniques from the last 2 years):**\n\nThe paper touches on the following trends and techniques relevant to adversarial robustness, citing papers published within the last 2 years (2021-2023):\n\n1.  **Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Robustness:**\n    *   The paper mentions a comprehensive analysis of the robustness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) towards common corruptions (Tian et al., 2022).  This indicates a trend in evaluating the inherent robustness of ViTs, a relatively newer architecture compared to CNNs.  The paper \"Deeper insights into ViTs robustness towards common corruptions\" (Tian et al., 2022) appears multiple times. The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding how ViTs behave under noisy or corrupted input conditions.\n\n2.  **Diffusion Models in Adversarial Training:**\n    *   The paper mentions the use of diffusion models in adversarial training (Wang et al., 2023): \"Better diffusion models further improve adversarial training\". This shows a trend toward leveraging generative models like diffusion models to improve the effectiveness of adversarial training.\n    *   Specifically, the paper references \"Better diffusion models further improve adversarial training\" (Wang et al., 2023)\n    *  Mentions other Diffusion Model papers: Gowal et al, 2021. Improving, and Rebuffi, 2021: Fixing.\n\n3.  **NoisyMix and Related Techniques:**\n    *   The paper mentions NoisyMix, a framework that combines data augmentations, stability training, and noise injections to improve robustness (Erichson et al., 2022). This indicates an interest in combining different regularization techniques for enhanced robustness.\n\n4.  **PRIME: Leveraging Primitive Transformations:**\n    *   Modas et al.

It's likely that research is ongoing to refine and combine these techniques.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:**  The paper acknowledges adversarial training as a standard approach but implies that existing strategies have limitations.\n\n*   **Benchmark Datasets:** The paper discusses benchmark datasets like ImageNet-C, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-P, AR101, PACS, Office-Home, MNIST-C, and WILDS. These are used for *evaluating* robustness but aren't robustness techniques themselves.\n\n**Key Insights from the Paper's Experiments:**\n\n*   The paper's adversarial benchmark, using simple distortions like Gaussian noise and blur, can effectively reduce the accuracy of state-of-the-art models, even those adversarially retrained.  This suggests that *even basic* adversarial attacks remain a challenge.\n*   The adversarial examples generated by the framework are transferable to other models. This indicates the presence of general vulnerabilities across architectures.\n*   Specifically, in ImageNet, the mean L2 level of ImageNet-C (99.3) is 69.0% higher than the mean L2 level on our distorted version of ImageNet (58.8) for Gaussian noise for the severity level of 5.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work (Potential Trends):**\n\n*   The paper mentions that their method focuses on vulnerabilities from distortions present at deployment.  This hints at a trend toward more realistic or application-specific adversarial attacks.\n*   Future work includes evaluations on additional naturally occurring perturbations.  This aligns with the idea of moving beyond synthetic attacks to more real-world scenarios.\n\n**Specific Papers Referenced Within the Last 2 Years (2021-2023):**\n\nHere's a list of the cited papers that fall within the last 2 years, which are most directly relevant to your research question:\n\n*   **Diffenderfer et al. (2021):** A winning hand: Compressing deep networks can improve out-of-distribution robustness.\n*   **Kireev et al.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of information from the provided paper, focused on answering the research question:  **\"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"**\n\n**Paper Title:** Meta Invariance Defense Towards Generalizable Robustness to Unknown Adversarial Attacks\n\n**Key Ideas and Contributions (within the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Problem Addressed:**  The paper directly addresses the lack of generalizable robustness in DNNs against *unknown* adversarial attacks.  Existing defenses are often tailored to *known* attacks (\"Leaky Attacks\") and fail when faced with unseen attack strategies. This is a critical weakness in real-world deployment. The paper was published in 2023, so it addresses trends in the previous 2 years.\n*   **Proposed Solution: Meta Invariance Defense (MID)**:  The core contribution is a novel adversarial defense method called MID, designed to improve robustness against both known and unknown attacks.  MID works by learning \"attack-invariant\" features.\n*   **Meta-Learning Approach:** MID leverages meta-learning to simulate defense against both \"simulated leaky attacks\" (known) and \"simulated unknown attacks\" during training. This is achieved through an Attacker Pool.\n    *   **Attacker Pool:**  A manually constructed pool of various adversarial attack combinations is used. This pool is sampled from randomly to create different defense tasks, simulating scenarios with both known and unknown attacks.\n    *   **Meta-Train and Meta-Test:** The meta-learning process involves two stages in each epoch: Meta-Train (robustness to known attacks) and Meta-Test (generalizable robustness to unknown attacks).\n        *   Meta-Train involves randomly sampling *n-1* attack combinations from the Attacker Pool. A temporary model is trained using a single-step gradient descent.\n        *   Meta-Test involves selecting the *n*th attack (not used in Meta-Train) to simulate unknown attacks. The temporary model is evaluated on this unknown attack.\n        *   The losses from both stages are combined to train the original model for robustness and generalization.\n*   **Multi-Consistency Distillation:**  To further learn attack-invariant features, MID incorporates a multi-consistency distillation protocol within the meta-learning framework. This involves training a student encoder supervised by a teacher network, which promotes semantic consistency with benign samples, extracting those attack-invariant features.\n    *   **Teacher-Student Framework:** A teacher network guides the adversarial robustness training of a student feature extractor (encoder). The teacher network is fixed during student training and comprises a teacher encoder, teacher classifier, and teacher decoder.\n    *   **Consistency Constraints:** The multi-consistency protocol consists of three components:\n        *   **Adversarial Consistency (AC):**  KL-divergence loss between the *features* of the teacher encoder (fed with benign samples) and the student encoder (fed with adversarial samples) to constrain the student to learn similar features.\n        *   **Cyclic Consistency (CC):**  The student encoder's output is decoded by the teacher decoder to regenerate a robust sample.  A KL-divergence loss then constrains the distribution similarity between the features of the regenerated image (re-encoded by the teacher) and the original image.\n        *   **Label Consistency (LC):** A cross-entropy loss ensures the student encoder and teacher classifier accurately predict the labels of adversarial samples.\n*   **Attack-Agnostic Defense and Robust Image Regeneration:** MID simultaneously achieves robustness to adversarial perturbations for high-level image classification and attack suppression in low-level robust image regeneration.\n*   **Theoretical Analysis:**  The paper provides theoretical justifications for MID's effectiveness from three perspectives:\n    *   **Taylor Expansion:** MID minimizes the loss of both known and unknown attacks while maximizing the cosine similarity of gradients between them, promoting attack-invariance.\n    *   **Manifold Interpretation:** MID learns the similarity between original (benign) and neighboring (adversarial) features, pulling adversarial samples back to the original manifold.  The teacher model uses an autoencoder to facilitate learning the neighbor distribution and robust sample regeneration.\n    *   **High-Order Optimization:** MID implicitly regularizes the second-derivative of the loss function, leading to flatter minima and improved generalization (as flatter functions are less sensitive to input shifts).  Meta-learning introduces an implicit second-order derivative optimization.\n\n**Experimental Results:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet-200, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K.\n*   **Backbones:** LeNet5, ResNet18, ResNet50, DenseNet121, ConvNext-B, Visual Transformer (small/base).\n*   **Attacks Used:** PGD, MIM, FGSM, BIM, CW, JSMA, Auto-Attack, SPA, SSAH, stAdv, DDN, FAB, Adv-Drop (targeted and non-targeted versions where applicable).\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   MID consistently demonstrates superior robustness to both *known* and *unknown* attacks compared to state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods (including adversarial training and defensive distillation).\n    *   MID achieves a higher average robustness and a better worst-case adversarial robustness (lower bound) than other methods.\n    *   Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component of MID (meta-learning, distillation, multi-consistency).\n    *   Larger teacher models may improve robustness to known attacks but do not clearly improve robustness to unknown attacks.\n    *   MID learns more discernible feature distributions and gradients with richer semantic information.\n    *   MID is sparser in model parameters and retains more \"benign-preservable\" parameters. The regenerated image contains almost no adversarial perturbation and preserves the semantics of benign images\n    *   Attention maps of MID are more semantic-focused than baseline models, showing more interpretable results.\n\n**Discussion Points Relevant to Trends:**\n\n*   **Generalizability:**  The paper strongly emphasizes the move away from defenses that are effective only against specific, known attacks.  The trend is towards methods that can generalize to unseen attacks.\n*   **Meta-Learning for Robustness:** Using meta-learning to simulate a variety of attack scenarios (both known and unknown) appears to be a promising direction for building more robust models. This allows for the learning of more generalizable defense strategies.\n*   **Distillation and Feature Invariance:**  The multi-consistency distillation approach suggests that learning and enforcing attack-invariant features is a key to robustness. By distilling knowledge from a teacher network that emphasizes these invariant features, the student network becomes more resilient.\n*   **Interpretability and Model Sparsity:** There is a trend towards more interpretable and sparser models which are naturally more robust against adversarial attacks.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   MID does not fully resolve the accuracy vs. robustness trade-off.  Accuracy on benign samples can decrease slightly. The large model + fine-tuning may alleviate this issue.\n*   The approach has increased computation cost.\n*   Generalization depends on the diversity of attacks in the Attacker Pool.\n*   It is difficult to access full prior knowledge of all unknown attacks.\n\nIn summary, the paper highlights the trend toward generalizable adversarial robustness using techniques like meta-learning, distillation, and feature invariance. The proposed MID method demonstrates promising results in defending against both known and unknown attacks, but it also reveals challenges that remain in achieving a perfect balance between accuracy, robustness, and computational cost."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the paper, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last two years (assuming the paper was written in 2024 or late 2023).\n\n**I. Core Idea & Novelty (Crucial for Trend Identification):**\n\n*   **Outlier Detection and Dimension Reduction (ODDR):** This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism against patch-based adversarial attacks. It's based on the idea that adversarial patches create features that are statistical outliers compared to the rest of the image.\n*   **Three-Stage Pipeline:**  ODDR works by:\n    *   **Fragmentation:** Dividing the image into overlapping patches.\n    *   **Segregation:**  Identifying outlier patches using Isolation Forest (an unsupervised outlier detection method).\n    *   **Neutralization:** Reducing the impact of the outlier patches using Dimension Reduction techniques (Singular Value Decomposition - SVD).\n*   **Model-Agnostic:**  The authors emphasize that ODDR is model-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to different image classification architectures (CNNs and Transformers) and other tasks (object detection, depth estimation). This is a relevant trend as defenses are increasingly designed to be generalizable.\n*   **Simplicity:** The authors highlight that the dimension reduction is less computationally intensive than neural network-based patch neutralization techniques.\n\n**II.  Performance & Comparisons (Evidence of Effectiveness):**\n\n*   **Image Classification Results:**\n    *   **Datasets:** ImageNet and Caltech-101.\n    *   **Models:** ResNet-152, ResNet-50, VGG-19, Inception V3, Vision Transformers (ViT b 16), and Swin Transformers (swin v2 b).  The inclusion of Transformers is important, indicating a focus on modern architectures.\n    *   **Attacks:**  Adversarial Patch (GAP), LAVAN, Generative Dynamic Patch Attack (GDPA), and Shape Matters (SM). The fact that these attacks are used means they are representative of current attack strategies.\n    *   **Key Result:** ODDR significantly improves robust accuracy against these attacks, with minimal impact on baseline accuracy. For example, achieving 79.1% accuracy against GoogleAP on ImageNet using CNNs, and 83.1% using Transformer-based architectures.\n    *   **Comparison to State-of-the-Art:** ODDR outperforms existing defenses like LGS, Jujutsu, and Jedi. Specifically,  better robust accuracy compared to LGS (53.86%), Jujutsu (60%), and Jedi (64.34%) against GoogleAP attacks.\n*   **Importance of Ablation Study:** The ablation study shows that both outlier detection and dimension reduction contribute to the defense's effectiveness. Outlier detection gives a 13% performance gain, according to the paper.\n*   **Adaptive Attack Resilience:** ODDR is shown to be reasonably resilient against adaptive attacks that try to mimic clean image distributions. Achieved a robust accuracy of 76% when tested against the adaptive attack.\n*   **Naturalistic Patch Defense:** The paper claims that ODDR is effective against naturalistic adversarial patches (mimic real objects).\n\n**III. Trends Indicated by this Paper:**\n\n*   **Focus on Patch-Based Attacks:** The paper addresses a relevant and persistent threat. Patch-based attacks are practical in real-world scenarios.\n*   **Emphasis on Model-Agnostic Defenses:** ODDR's design aims to protect a variety of architectures, signifying a move towards more generalizable defense strategies.\n*   **Statistical Outlier Detection:** Using statistical methods like Isolation Forest for anomaly detection is a relevant trend. It offers a different approach than purely neural network-based defenses and can be computationally efficient.\n*   **Dimension Reduction as a Defense:** Using dimension reduction as a means of neutralizing adversarial perturbations is relevant. The paper argues for its simplicity and ability to preserve important information compared to other neutralization methods.\n*   **Transformer Robustness:** The paper explicitly evaluates and highlights the performance of ODDR on Transformer-based architectures (Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers). This shows awareness of the increasing prevalence of Transformers in image classification and the need to develop defenses suitable for them.\n*   **Trade-off Between Empirical and Certified Defenses:** The comparison with certified defenses acknowledges the gap between provable robustness and practical utility. Empirical defenses still tend to perform better in real-world scenarios, so they're still being actively researched.\n*   **Adaptive Attacks:** The authors also test against adaptive attacks, showing that it's important to consider how defenses might be bypassed by attackers that are aware of the defense mechanism.\n*    **Explainability:** The paper touches on explainability, showing that the defense restores model interpretability, as evidenced by Grad-CAM visualizations.\n\n**IV. Key Details to Note:**\n\n*   **White-Box Threat Model:** The evaluation is done under a strong white-box assumption, where the attacker knows the entire defense mechanism.\n*   **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The authors acknowledge the importance of hyperparameter tuning.\n*   **Computational Cost:**  ODDR is designed to be computationally efficient, making it potentially suitable for resource-constrained devices.\n\n**V. Limitations (Not Explicitly Stated, but Inferred):**\n\n*   The paper provides extensive empirical results, but lacks formal theoretical guarantees of robustness.\n*   While the defense shows resilience to an adaptive attack, it is difficult to claim comprehensive robustness against *all* possible adaptive attack strategies.\n*   Performance against a broader range of attacks, especially those evolving rapidly, would provide a more complete picture.\n\nIn summary, this paper contributes to the trend of developing practical, model-agnostic defenses against patch-based adversarial attacks, leveraging statistical outlier detection and dimension reduction techniques. The evaluation on modern architectures, including Transformers, and the inclusion of an adaptive attack analysis make it relevant to current research in adversarial robustness for image classification."

While it does touch upon AEs in classification as a comparison, its main contribution and findings are in the context of segmentation.  This means that strictly speaking, the paper isn't directly answering the research question about image *classification* robustness.\n\n**Key Information Relevant to Adversarial Robustness (with a Classification Angle):**\n\nEven though segmentation is the primary focus, there are still some potentially relevant findings/observations about classification:\n\n*   **Overfitting in Classification:** The paper highlights the issue of \"overfitting\" of adversarial examples to the *source* classification model used to generate them. This overfitting limits their transferability (i.e., their ability to fool *other* classification models).\n\n    *   The paper notes that when too few attack iterations are applied when creating AEs, the AEs *underfit* the source model.\n    *   Conversely, too many attack iterations lead to *overfitting*, also reducing transferability.\n    *   This is a well-known problem in adversarial robustness for classification. The paper references many existing efforts to overcome this overfitting problem (see citations [7, 8, 13, 19, 20, 23, 24, 37\u201339, 42, 46]).\n    *   The paper specifically tests the transferability of AEs *between* different classification architectures (VGG, ResNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet, MNasNet).\n\n*   **Architectural Impact on Overfitting (Classification):** The paper observes that *the architecture of the classification model affects how severely AEs overfit*.\n\n    *   AEs generated on ResNet models (which use skip connections/residual blocks) tend to overfit *more drastically* than those generated on VGG models. The authors attribute this to the residual connections learning different mappings, causing AEs to overfit these connections specifically.\n    *   GoogleNet and MobileNet (with multiple paths in each block, but no skip connections) overfit less drastically than ResNet, but slightly more drastically than VGG.\n\n*   **Sensitivity to Attack Iterations (Classification):**  The paper underscores that the transferability of AEs in classification is highly sensitive to the *number of attack iterations* used to create them.\n\n    *   The authors point out that there's no clear guideline for choosing the optimal number of iterations for transferability.  It's often selected empirically (e.g., 10 or 20 iterations).\n    *   The paper's experiments show that empirically selected iteration numbers can sometimes be near optimal, but this isn't guaranteed.\n\n*   **Attack Methods:** The paper uses the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) for generating adversarial examples for both classification and segmentation. This is a multi-step (iterative) attack based on the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).\n\n**Details from Experimental Setup (Classification):**\n\n*   **Models Tested:** VGG16, ResNet50, GoogleNet, MobileNet, MNasNet (pretrained models from PyTorch)\n*   **Dataset:** ImageNet 1k (10k images randomly selected from the validation set)\n*   **Attack Parameters:**\n    *   Perturbation range (epsilon): 0.03 (assuming image range [0, 1])\n    *   Step size (alpha): 0.01\n*   **Evaluation Metric:** Classification accuracy (%) on target models (lower accuracy = better transferability).\n\n**Key Findings (Classification - though secondary to the paper's main focus):**\n\n*   Transferability is low when too few or too many attack iterations are used (due to underfitting or overfitting, respectively).\n*   ResNet models exhibit more drastic overfitting compared to VGG.\n*   The optimal number of attack iterations for transferability is difficult to determine and is often selected empirically.\n\n**Why This Isn't a Direct Answer:**\n\nThe paper *uses* the findings about classification transferability as a *baseline* and *comparison point* for its main investigation into segmentation. The authors are essentially saying, \"We know these things about classification AEs... now, what happens when we look at segmentation models?\" The key novel contributions are about segmentation AEs, not classification.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWhile this paper isn't a dedicated study of *recent trends* in adversarial robustness for *image classification*, it provides valuable context regarding the challenges of transferability and the impact of model architecture on overfitting, which are ongoing areas of research in classification robustness.

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper and Relevance to Adversarial Robustness**\n\nThis paper explores adversarial robustness in image classification by examining the connection between adversarially robust neural networks and human peripheral vision.  It doesn't directly introduce new adversarial attacks or defenses *per se*, but it *investigates the underlying mechanisms* that might contribute to robustness, drawing parallels to biological vision.  The core idea is that adversarially trained networks might, in some ways, be learning representations similar to how humans process images in their periphery, which inherently provides some robustness.\n\n**Key Findings & Arguments Related to Adversarial Robustness (and relevant citations from the last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Texture-based representations and robustness:** The paper posits that localized texture summary statistic representations might drive human invariance to adversarial perturbations. This suggests that incorporating such representations into DNNs could lead to adversarial robustness. The authors do not directly provide details of such DNN architectures, however.\n\n2.  **Alignment of robust networks with human perception:** The paper builds on previous findings (cited within the paper from before the last 2 years, e.g., Ilyas et al., 2019; Santurkar et al., 2019; Engstrom et al., 2019) that adversarially robust networks learn representations that are more aligned with human perception than non-robust networks.  This alignment is explored specifically in the context of peripheral vision.\n\n3.  **Adversarial Training is a Strategy:** The paper mentions that adversarial training is a popular strategy to alleviate sensitivities to adversarial perturbations (Madry et al., 2017 and Tsipras et al., 2019).\n\n4.  **Other strategies to alleviate sensitivity to adversarial perturbations:** The paper mentioned data augmentation (Rebuffi et al., 2021; Gowal et al., 2021) and biologically plausible inductive biases (Dapello et al., 2020; Reddy et al., 2020; Jonnalagadda et al., 2021).\n\n5.  **Robustness in the periphery:** The central experimental finding is that adversarially robust representations are more similar to human peripheral computation than non-robust representations.  This is demonstrated through psychophysical experiments where human observers struggle to distinguish between images synthesized to match adversarially robust representations and images synthesized using a texture model of peripheral vision (Texforms).\n\n**Specific Experimental Details & Justification:**\n\n*   **Psychophysical Experiments:** The researchers conducted psychophysical experiments where human subjects were asked to discriminate between different types of synthesized images at varying degrees of retinal eccentricity (distance from the center of gaze).  The key comparison was between images synthesized from:\n\n    *   Adversarially trained networks (\"robust\" stimuli)\n    *   Standard (non-adversarially trained) networks (\"standard\" stimuli)\n    *   A texture synthesis model of peripheral vision (\"Texforms\")\n\n*   **Stimuli Synthesis:** Images were synthesized to match the feature responses of the different models (adversarially trained, standard, Texforms). This \"analysis-by-synthesis\" approach aimed to create images that, to each model, would be similar to the original image.  The specific procedure used gradient descent to minimize the difference between the representation of the second-to-last network layer of a target image and an initial noise seed.\n*   **Models Used:** The ResNet-50 models of Santurkar et al. (2019); Ilyas et al. (2019); Engstrom et al. (2019) were used. These models were trained on a subset of ImageNet, termed Restricted ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015).\n\n**Implications for Adversarial Robustness:**\n\n*   **Biological Inspiration:** The paper suggests that understanding the mechanisms of human peripheral vision could inspire new approaches to building more robust DNNs. The idea is that the texture-based processing in the periphery naturally leads to some invariance to perturbations.\n\n*   **Localized Texture Computations:** The paper indicates that localized texture computation leads to a robust hyper-plane during learning for the observer.\n\n**Limitations & Future Directions (from the paper):**\n\n*   **Biological Plausibility Disclaimer:** The authors acknowledge that their use of \"biological plausibility\" is at a representational level.  They mention ongoing work to investigate the physiological components (temporal dynamics and localization) evoked by the stimuli using MEG and fMRI.\n\n**Relevant Citations (from the last 2 years):**\n\n*   **Alsallakh et al., 2021:** Discusses how CNNs can develop blind spots, highlighting vulnerabilities.\n*   **Geirhos et al., 2021:** Investigates the gap between human and machine vision, emphasizing the challenges in achieving true robustness.\n*   **Funke et al., 2021:** Provides points to check when comparing visual perception in humans and machines.\n*   **Herrera-Esposito et al., 2021:** Explores contextual modulation of texture perception in peripheral vision.\n*   **Hinton, 2021:** Discusses how to represent part-whole hierarchies in a neural network.\n*   **Jonnalagadda et al., 2021:** Presents Foveater: Foveated transformer for image classification.\n*   **Rebuffi et al., 2021:** Focuses on fixing data augmentation to improve adversarial robustness.\n*   **Ziemba and Simoncelli, 2021:** Examines opposing effects of selectivity and invariance in peripheral vision.\n\n**In summary:** This paper contributes to the field of adversarial robustness by exploring potential connections between robust DNN representations and biological vision, specifically peripheral vision and texture-based processing.  It provides empirical evidence suggesting that adversarially trained networks might be learning transformations similar to those in the human visual periphery, which could contribute to their robustness.  The cited papers from the last two years reflect ongoing efforts to understand the limitations of current DNNs and explore new architectures and training methods to improve robustness."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on answering the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Key Points Related to Adversarial Robustness & Trends (Focusing on the last 2 years based on the paper's publication date):**\n\n*   **Auxiliary Convolutional Neural Networks (AuxCNNs) for Robustness:** The paper highlights a trend of using AuxCNNs to improve the robustness of image classification models. AuxCNNs are added on top of traditional classification networks to help train intermediate layers. The goal is to leverage informative features from these intermediate layers, which can improve classification performance and reduce overfitting, ultimately enhancing robustness.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as Auxiliary Networks:** The core novelty of this paper lies in using a GAN as an AuxCNN. The paper points to a growing interest in GANs for image classification, especially to address overfitting issues, a common cause of poor robustness.\n    *   **GANs for Data Augmentation:** GANs are used to synthesize new images, augmenting the training dataset. This helps improve the generalization ability of the classifier and, consequently, its robustness.\n    *   **GANs as Feature Extractors:** The discriminator part of a GAN can be used directly as an image classifier, leveraging the feature extraction capabilities learned during adversarial training.\n*   **Adversarial Training:** The use of adversarial training methods, where the model is trained to be robust against adversarial examples (intentionally perturbed inputs designed to fool the classifier), is implicit in the GAN framework.\n*   **Hybrid Loss Functions:** Designing specialized loss functions that combine different objectives (e.g., classification accuracy, image reconstruction quality, adversarial loss) is crucial for effective adversarial training and robustness.\n\n**Details Extracted from the Paper:**\n\n1.  **AuxCNN Architecture:** The proposed AuxCNN includes:\n\n    *   **Image Generator (R-Net):** Reconstructs input images based on features extracted by the main classification network (F-Net). This forces the F-Net to learn richer, more representative features.\n    *   **Image Discriminator (D-Net):** Distinguishes between real and reconstructed images, ensuring semantic similarity.  It also classifies the image class label\n2.  **Adversarial Learning Strategy:**\n\n    *   The AuxCNN (GAN) is trained *in conjunction* with the main classification network (F-Net) in an end-to-end manner. This is a key design choice that differs from approaches where GANs are trained separately and then used for data augmentation or classification.\n    *   A \"hybrid loss function\" guides the training:\n        *   **Classification Loss (Lcls):** Standard cross-entropy loss for the classification task.\n        *   **Reconstruction Loss (Lrec):** Measures the similarity between original and reconstructed images (using Structural Similarity Index, SSIM).  This encourages the F-Net to extract features that are useful for reconstruction.\n        *   **Adversarial Loss (Ladv):**  Composed of two losses:\n            *   *Discrimination Loss (Ldisc_adv):*  Measures the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and reconstructed images.\n            *   *Classification Loss (Lcls_adv):* Measures the classification head of D-Net.\n3.  **Specific Network Architectures Used:**\n\n    *   **F-Net (Feature Extraction):** Standard ResNet architectures (ResNet12, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet44, ResNet50).\n    *   **R-Net (Generator):** Adapted from InfoGAN.\n    *   **D-Net (Discriminator):** Based on the discriminative network in PatchGAN.\n4.  **Experimental Results:**\n\n    *   The proposed method consistently outperforms other methods (ROS, Focal Loss, Hard Example Mining) in medical image classification tasks (COVID-19 detection from X-rays, and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma risk assessment from PET images). The results suggest improved robustness to data imbalance and inter-class similarity.\n    *   Ablation studies demonstrate that both the generator (R-Net) and discriminator (D-Net) contribute to improved performance.\n    *   The paper investigates the impact of various factors on the effectiveness of the approach, including:\n        *   **F-Net network depth**\n        *   **Image size of training data**\n        *   **Training dataset size**\n        *   **Transfer learning (TL) method**\n\n**Why This is Relevant to the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Learning:** The GAN-based AuxCNN *is* a form of adversarial learning, even if it's not explicitly training against crafted adversarial examples (like FGSM or PGD).  The generator and discriminator are in an adversarial game, and the classification network benefits from the features learned in that process. This learning aims to find features which can make the model more robust.\n*   **Focus on Medical Images:**  The paper addresses robustness challenges specific to medical image classification (limited data, class imbalance, subtle differences between classes).\n*   **Recent Work:**  The paper and the cited references are recent (within the last few years), indicating the currency of these trends.\n*   **Auxiliary Networks:** The paper introduces the utilization of Auxiliary Networks as an additional regularization and improvement of the classification performance.\n\n**Limitations (Considering the Research Question):**\n\n*   **Not Explicitly Adversarial Attacks:** The paper doesn't directly evaluate robustness against *specific* adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, CW). It focuses on improving generalization and performance on real-world data, which *implies* better robustness, but doesn't prove it.\n*   **Medical Image Focus:** The findings are specific to medical image classification. While the underlying principles may be applicable to other image domains, the specific network architectures and hyperparameter settings may need to be adjusted.\n*   **Limited Scope:** The paper is a single study, and a broader literature review would be necessary to confirm these as *general* trends.\n\nIn summary, the paper provides valuable insights into a trend of using GANs as auxiliary networks within AuxCNNs to improve the robustness and performance of image classification models, particularly in the context of medical imaging where data limitations and class imbalances are common challenges. While it doesn't directly address robustness against specific adversarial attacks, the techniques presented aim to learn more robust and generalizable features, which is a crucial aspect of adversarial robustness."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed extraction, focusing on trends and recency (keeping in mind the paper's publication date isn't explicitly stated, but internal citations suggest a timeframe):\n\n**I. Core Idea & Relevance to the Research Question**\n\n*   **Focus:** The paper investigates versatile defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks in image classification, specifically using image-to-image translation techniques. This aligns directly with the research question as it explores a method to improve *adversarial robustness*.\n*   **Key Trend:** Image-to-image translation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is presented as a *promising trend* for creating robust defense models. The authors specifically use a Pix2pix-based approach.\n*   **Versatility:** The central theme is developing a *single, versatile* defense model capable of resisting *multiple* types of adversarial attacks, rather than training individual models for each specific attack. This concept of creating universal defense systems is a prominent trend.\n\n**II. Key Findings & Contributions (as Stated by the Authors)**\n\n*   **Generalizability:** The paper claims to demonstrate that image-to-image translation-based defense methods have *better generalizability* to *unknown* adversarial attacks than other existing defense methods.

      "summary": "Here's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper to address the research question:\n\n**Research Question:** What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**Paper Title:** Symmetry Defense Against CNN Adversarial Perturbation Attacks\n\n**Key Findings and Trends (as presented by the paper):**\n\n*   **Symmetry-Based Defenses:** This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism that leverages the *lack* of perfect symmetry handling in CNNs to counter adversarial attacks. The core idea is that while CNNs are designed to incorporate symmetries (horizontal flipping, rotations, translations), they don't achieve perfect invariance to these transformations, especially in the presence of adversarial perturbations.\n\n    *   **Horizontal Flip Symmetry:** The paper proposes a defense that horizontally flips an image and then classifies it. This showed success against zero-knowledge adversaries (adversaries unaware of the defense).\n    *   **Pixel Intensity Inversion Symmetry:** The paper also uses a pixel intensity inversion symmetry (changing pixel values *p* to 1-*p*). This is applied by training a separate model with inverted images. The defense inverts an input image and classifies it using this dedicated \"inverted\" model. This also shows good results against zero-knowledge attacks.\n    *   **Symmetry Subgroup Defense:** To defend against *perfect-knowledge* adversaries (those aware of the symmetry defense), the paper introduces a defense using a combination of symmetries: identity, horizontal flipping, intensity inversion, and the combination of flipping and inversion.  The defense classifies an image based on the consensus of the classifications of all four symmetric versions of the image.\n\n*   **Adaptive Attacks and Limitations:** The paper argues that adaptive attacks, which attempt to circumvent the symmetry defense by incorporating symmetry into their loss functions, are often *not* optimal due to CNNs' inherent difficulty in handling symmetry. The optimization of the attack is negatively affected because the CNN produces different function values for symmetric images.\n*   **Zero-Knowledge vs. Perfect-Knowledge Adversaries:** The paper explicitly addresses both scenarios:\n    *   *Zero-knowledge*: The adversary is unaware of the symmetry defense.\n    *   *Perfect-knowledge*: The adversary is fully aware and can adapt.\n*   **Emphasis on Realistic Attack Scenarios:** A key motivation is to move away from defenses that rely on *attack knowledge* (i.e., needing to know the specific attack in advance to train against it), which the authors deem unrealistic.\n*   **Evaluation Methodology:**  The paper utilizes a robust evaluation methodology based on recommendations in [7], considering different threat models. They use standard datasets (ImageNet) and established attacks (PGD, AutoAttack variants like APGD, Square Attack). The code is based on the robustness library [18].\n\n**Specific Claims & Results:**\n\n*   The symmetry defense succeeds against gradient-based attacks and random search without using adversarial images or attack knowledge.\n*   The symmetry defense counters zero-knowledge adversaries with near-default accuracies.\n*   The defense also counters perfect-knowledge adversaries with near-default accuracies.\n*   The usage of pixel intensity inversion symmetry means that the proposed defense could be applied even to datasets without existing symmetries.\n*   The symmetry defense maintains and even exceeds the non-adversarial accuracy against perfect-knowledge adversaries.\n*   The defense exceeds the classification accuracies of the current best defense, which uses adversarial images.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question (Latest Trends):**\n\n*   **Focus on Model Inherent Properties:** The paper moves towards defenses that exploit the *inherent properties and limitations* of CNNs, rather than relying solely on data augmentation or attack-specific training.\n*   **Beyond Adversarial Training:** It presents a compelling alternative to adversarial training (AT), which, while effective, has drawbacks in terms of computational cost and reliance on attack knowledge.\n*   **Adaptive Attack Resistance:**  The work emphasizes the importance of designing defenses that are robust against adaptive adversaries who are aware of the defense mechanism and can try to circumvent it.\n*   **Practicality:** By maintaining the original classifier's architecture and training process, the defense aims for ease of deployment.\n\n**Limitations of the paper (that could indicate future research directions):**\n\n*   While the paper claims success against adaptive attacks, further investigation into more sophisticated adaptive strategies is warranted.\n*   The symmetry defense uses the same computational complexity as a default classifier in training.\n*   The paper tests only on the ImageNet dataset. It is necessary to check if this would generalize to other types of datasets.\n\n**In summary,** this paper highlights a trend toward defenses that exploit the inherent limitations of CNN architectures, specifically their imperfect handling of symmetry, to achieve adversarial robustness. This approach offers a potential alternative to traditional adversarial training and emphasizes resistance to adaptive attacks, making it a relevant contribution to the current research landscape."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Towards Adversarial Purification using Denoising AutoEncoders\n\n**Publication Date:**  While the exact publication date is not explicitly given, the reference list includes publications up to 2022. The presence of \"Li, F.; Du, X.; and Zhang, L. 2022\" suggests this paper was likely published in late 2022 or 2023, making it relevant to the research question as it falls within the last 2 years.\n\n**Key Areas and Trends Addressed in the Paper Related to Adversarial Robustness (Last 2 Years Perspective):**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on **adversarial purification** as a defense mechanism.  Adversarial purification aims to remove adversarial perturbations from input images, making them more easily classified by standard models.  This approach differs from adversarial training, which aims to make the classifier itself more robust.  Here's a breakdown of the key trends and techniques discussed and/or employed, with a focus on what makes them \"latest\":\n\n1.  **Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) for Purification:**  The core idea is to use DAEs to map adversarial examples back to their clean counterparts. The use of autoencoders for adversarial defense isn't entirely new (Defense-GAN is mentioned, which is older), but the *specific application and adaptive usage* is what the authors present as novel. One recent work is cited within this context: \"(Cho et al. 2020) propose use of DAEs but for defense of image segmentation models instead\". Therefore, the use of DAEs is *not* necessarily a new trend (DAEs themselves have been around for a while), but their application to adversarial *purification* for *image classification*, with specific adaptive techniques, is a current area of exploration.\n2.  **Adaptive Purification:** A key element of the paper is the adaptive manner in which the DAE is used. Instead of directly feeding the (potentially adversarial) image through the DAE and taking the output, the authors propose an iterative process. They modify the *input image itself* to minimize the reconstruction error of the DAE. This is intended to avoid blurring artifacts that can occur when directly using the DAE output, and also to make the defense non-differentiable, thereby thwarting certain adaptive attacks.  This adaptive approach seems to be a more recent refinement.\n3. **Non-Differentiable Defenses:** A significant trend in adversarial robustness is the development of defenses that are difficult or impossible to differentiate through. Traditional gradient-based attacks rely on being able to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input image. By making the defense non-differentiable, it becomes harder to craft effective attacks. The proposed adaptive purification method is explicitly designed to be non-differentiable.\n4.  **Defense Against Grey-Box Attacks:** The paper emphasizes testing the defense against strong grey-box attacks (attacker knows the target classifier but *not* the defense model). Evaluating defenses under realistic threat models is crucial, and grey-box attacks represent a more challenging scenario than simple white-box attacks where the attacker knows everything.\n5.  **Countering Adaptive Attacks:**  The paper explores potential adaptive attacks specifically designed to circumvent the APuDAE defense.  This is a critical step in evaluating the true robustness of any defense mechanism.  The authors devise two counter-attacks:\n    *   **Counter Attack A:** Approximates the transformation function of the defense with a differentiable autoencoder, enabling a gradient-based attack.\n    *   **Counter Attack B:** Modifies the loss function of a BIM attack to incorporate a term that minimizes the reconstruction error of the purifier, effectively attacking both the classifier and the purifier.\n6. **Defenses Combined with other techniques**: The paper also explores the use of adding random transformations and noise at each step in the purification process to further improve adversarial accuracy. Adding random rotate and resize transformations to the input image has also been observed to improve the classification accuracy for adversarial examples\n7.  **Evaluation on Standard Datasets:** The paper evaluates the approach on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.  These are standard datasets for evaluating adversarial robustness, allowing for comparison with other methods. The use of the ILSVRC-12 challenge dataset for ImageNet is also a common practice.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Algorithms Mentioned:**\n\n*   **Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs)**: The core technology used for purification.\n*   **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)**: A basic, but widely used, adversarial attack.\n*   **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) / Basic Iterative Method (BIM)**: A stronger iterative attack.\n*   **Carlini-Wagner (CW) Attack:** A sophisticated optimization-based attack.\n*   **ADAM Optimizer:** Used for adaptively updating the input image during the purification process.\n*   **Skip Connections**: A technique to improve DAE training\n*   **Random Transformation**: Add random rotate and resize transformations to the input image\n\n**Limitations & Future Directions:**\n\n*   The authors suggest exploring the use of adversary detection algorithms to provide feedback for purifying adversaries adaptively using the APuDAE method.\n\n**In summary, this paper highlights a trend towards more sophisticated adversarial defense strategies that go beyond simple adversarial training.  Adaptive purification methods, non-differentiable defenses, and rigorous evaluation against adaptive attacks are all important themes in current research on adversarial robustness.**"

It doesn't directly present \"latest trends\" in adversarial robustness. Instead, it proposes and evaluates a novel *defense* mechanism (symmetry defense) against adversarial attacks, specifically focusing on XGBoost classifiers, which are *not* typically used for image classification. The connection to image classification comes from drawing inspiration from symmetry defenses used in CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), which are the workhorse of image classification. This paper addresses the trend of adversarial attacks generalizing to tree-based models as well. The paper was published in 2022 which is within the last 2 years.\n\n**Key Information Extracted and Organized**\n\nHere's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information, organized to address the research question:\n\n*   **Defense Strategy:** Symmetry Defense\n    *   **Core Idea:** Exploits the lack of invariance in XGBoost classifiers with respect to symmetries (like feature inversion or horizontal flips) to revert adversarial sample classifications to the original, correct classifications. This idea is inspired by similar defenses in CNNs.\n    *   This aligns with a trend in adversarial robustness of leveraging model properties rather than just relying on adversarial training.\n\n*   **Type of Classifier Targeted:** XGBoost (Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees)\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:**  Indirect. XGBoost classifiers are *not* primarily used for image classification.  However, the defense draws inspiration from CNN defenses, which are heavily used in image classification.

The paper uses feature inversion and horizontal flips.\n    *   Attacks Evaluated Against: MILP, LT-Attack, Cube, OPT, SignOPT, HSJA.\n\n*   **Datasets Used:**\n\n    *   The paper primarily uses datasets that are *not* image datasets (e.g., breast-cancer, diabetes, ijcnn, webspam, covtype, HIGGS).\n\n    *   *Exception:* F-MNIST (Fashion-MNIST) *is* an image dataset, making it relevant to the \"image classification\" aspect of the research question. The paper applies both feature inversion and horizontal flip symmetries to F-MNIST.\n\n*   **Key Results & Claims:**\n\n    *   XGBoost classifiers, like CNNs, lack invariance with respect to symmetries.\n    *   The proposed symmetry defense can significantly improve accuracy against adversarial attacks, even when the adversary has no knowledge of the defense (zero-knowledge).  In some cases, achieves up to 100% accuracy on adversarial samples where default and robust classifiers have 0% accuracy.\n    *   Against perfect-knowledge adversaries (using F-MNIST), the symmetry defense can achieve over 95% accuracy on adversarial samples, exceeding default and robust classifiers.\n    *   The symmetry defense can make some attacks (MILP, LT-Attack, Cube) ineffective in generating adversarial samples.\n    *   Training with symmetric samples affects classifier adversarial robustness.\n\n*   **Underlying Cause of Lack of Invariance:**\n    *   The paper identifies the imbalance of XGBoost splitting conditions as an inherent cause, even if the splitting condition values correspond.\n\n*   **Connection to CNNs:**\n    *   The symmetry defense is inspired by recent work on CNN symmetry defenses. The paper leverages the CNN lack of invariance to revert the classification of adversarial samples to the original correct classification for several attacks without using any attack knowledge.\n\n**Why This is Relevant to \"Latest Trends\"**\n\n1.  **Beyond CNNs:**  The paper contributes to a trend of researching adversarial vulnerabilities *beyond* CNNs. The fact that tree-based models like XGBoost are also susceptible is important.\n2.  **Defense Strategies:** The paper explores alternative defense strategies *beyond* adversarial training. Symmetry-based defenses are a different approach.\n3.  **Invariance Properties:** It highlights the importance of invariance (or lack thereof) in model robustness. This relates to the ongoing investigation of what makes neural networks vulnerable and how to design more robust architectures.\n4.  **Zero-Knowledge Defense:** The success of the defense against zero-knowledge adversaries is a valuable property, as it means the defense does not require prior knowledge of the specific attack.\n\n**Limitations & Caveats (Based on the Paper)**\n\n*   **Not Directly Image-Focused:** Most of the experiments are performed on non-image datasets.\n*   **Lack of Inherent Symmetries:** The lack of inherent symmetries in non-image datasets limits the application of the symmetry defense against perfect-knowledge attacks where two symmetries are needed.\n*   **Computational Resources:** The defense doubles or quadruples computational resources because of augmenting the training dataset.\n*   **Fragmenation of input space**: The symmetry defense increases the number of splitting conditions in the classifier, causing the input space to fragment into smaller areas with samples with the same classification.\n\n**In summary:** This paper is most relevant as an *analogous study* to adversarial robustness in image classification. It adapts concepts from CNN defenses to a different type of model (XGBoost) and explores the importance of invariance properties, which are relevant themes in the broader field of adversarial machine learning, including image classification. It's a step toward generalizing adversarial robustness techniques."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper and extract the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on privacy-preserving image classification using encryption-then-compression (EtC) images and isotropic networks (Vision Transformer and ConvMixer). A key aspect is maintaining high classification accuracy and robustness against attacks while preserving privacy, and also considering image compressibility.  While it touches on robustness against attacks, it's primarily in the context of *privacy* attacks (recovering visual information from encrypted images) rather than adversarial attacks in the traditional sense (perturbations to the image to fool the classifier).\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness (with Caveats):**\n\nThe paper's discussion of robustness is primarily about protecting the *privacy* of the images, not necessarily making the classifier immune to adversarial examples.  However, there are some connections that can be made:\n\n1.  **Attacks Considered:** The paper *does* consider a few types of attacks that have some relevance to adversarial robustness, even though the goal is different:\n\n    *   **Feature Reconstruction Attack (FR-Attack):** This attack exploits local properties of encrypted images to reconstruct visual information.  While not directly about adversarial examples, it highlights the vulnerability of some encryption methods to information leakage.\n\n    *   **GAN-based Attack (GAN-Attack):** This uses a Generative Adversarial Network to try and reconstruct the original image from the encrypted version.\n\n    *   **Inverse Transformation Network Attack (ITN-Attack):**  This attack attempts to learn the inverse transformation to decrypt the images, thus compromising privacy.\n\n2. **Method for robustness:** The paper utilizes EtC (Encryption then Compression) to improve robustness.\n\n3.  **Isotropic Networks and Patch Embedding:** The paper argues that the patch embedding operation in isotropic networks (like ViT and ConvMixer) helps to reduce the influence of encryption on classification accuracy. They theorize that patch embedding can express the encryption steps as a transformation, thus making the network more resilient *to the encryption itself*. This can *indirectly* be seen as a form of robustness, albeit against a specific type of \"noise\" introduced by the encryption process, rather than the typical adversarial noise.\n\n**Key Findings Related to Robustness (within the Privacy Context):**\n\n*   **EtC Images and Robustness:** The paper claims that their proposed method using EtC images outperforms previous privacy-preserving methods in terms of robustness *against the attacks they consider*. They specifically mention robustness against ciphertext-only attacks and jigsaw puzzle solver attacks.  They also show that EtC images are more robust against FR-Attack, GAN-Attack, and ITN-Attack compared to other encryption methods like LE and PE (based on SSIM values and visual inspection of reconstructed images).\n\n*   **Comparison to Other Encryption Methods:** The paper contrasts its approach with other learnable encryption methods like LE, ELE, and PE.  They argue that EtC offers a better balance of high accuracy, robustness against privacy attacks, and compressibility.  ELE is noted as being robust against attacks but suffers from other limitations (inability to handle large images, lack of compressibility).\n\n**Limitations and Caveats:**\n\n*   **Privacy vs. Adversarial Robustness:**  It's crucial to reiterate that the *primary* focus is privacy, not traditional adversarial robustness. The attacks considered aim to reveal the original image, not to cause the classifier to misclassify.\n*   **Limited Scope of Attacks:** The paper only evaluates robustness against a specific set of attacks (FR-Attack, GAN-Attack, ITN-Attack, and some ciphertext-only attacks).  It doesn't explore the classifier's vulnerability to standard adversarial attacks like FGSM, PGD, etc.\n*   **Dataset Specificity:** The experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10 and Imagenette. Results might not generalize to other datasets.\n*   **No Provable Security:** The paper acknowledges that perceptual-encryption-based methods do not have provable security.\n\n**Papers Cited Relevant to Robustness/Attacks (Within the Last 2 Years):**\n\n*   **[3] H.

However, the lack of evaluation against standard adversarial attacks means its direct contribution to adversarial robustness research is limited.

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of information relevant to the research question, \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\":\n\n**Overall Relevance to the Research Question:**\n\nWhile the paper primarily focuses on adversarial attacks in *image segmentation*, and not directly on adversarial robustness, it does provide insights into attack methodologies and their effectiveness. Understanding attack strategies is crucial for developing robust defenses.  The paper explores the effectiveness of Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Adaptive Segmentation Mask Attack (ASMA) against image segmentation models. Although the research question specifically asks about robustness, understanding the nature of the attacks is a component of developing robustness.\n\n**Key Information Extracted (with a focus on trends and relevance to robustness, even indirectly):**\n\n1.  **Focus on Image Segmentation:** The paper highlights a trend of extending adversarial attack research beyond standard image classification to the more complex task of image segmentation. This suggests a growing interest in the vulnerability of dense prediction tasks.\n\n2.  **Attack Methodologies Examined:**\n\n    *   **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD):**  The paper uses PGD as a benchmark attack. The iterative nature of PGD, combined with the projection step to stay within an epsilon ball around the original image, makes it a strong first-order adversary. This highlights the continuing importance of PGD as a standard for evaluating adversarial robustness.\n\n        *   The paper defines PGD mathematically. The attack aims to find a perturbation P such that _P = argmin|P |<\u03b5(L(g(X + P_ ), Yt)), where L is cross-entropy loss, g is the neural network, X is the input image, P is the perturbation, and Yt is the target segmentation mask. The perturbation is restricted by epsilon to ensure visual similarity.\n\n    *   **Adaptive Segmentation Mask Attack (ASMA):** The paper explores ASMA, originally designed for binary biomedical image segmentation, and attempts to generalize it to multi-class segmentation. ASMA attempts to minimize the perturbation while maximizing the probability of segmenting pixels to match a target segmentation mask.\n\n        *   _Pn =  M \u22121 \u03a3 \u2207x(g(Xn)c \u2299 1Yt=c \u2299 1argmaxM (g(xn))\u0338=c)_ where \u2299 is the element wise product, and M is the number of segmentation classes. \u03b1n = \u03b2 \u00b7 IoU (Yt, g(Xn)) + \u03c4, where \u03b2 and \u03c4 are hyperparameters, and the intersection over union (IoU) is calculated and used to determine the percentage of the same classified pixels between two segmentation masks.\n\n3.  **Architectures Under Attack:**  The paper examines the vulnerability of DeepLabV3, a popular image segmentation architecture, with two different backbones:\n\n    *   **MobileNetV3:** Represents a trend towards efficient, mobile-friendly models.  Evaluating adversarial vulnerability on such models is important for real-world deployment.\n    *   **ResNet50:** A more traditional, deeper architecture.  Its inclusion provides a contrast to MobileNetV3 and allows for assessing the impact of architecture on adversarial susceptibility.\n\n4.  **Evaluation Metrics:**  The paper uses standard metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union), pixel accuracy, and L2 norm of the perturbation to quantify the success of the attacks.  L2 norm is used to measure the size of the perturbation introduced, which directly relates to the imperceptibility of the attack. This highlights a standard practice in evaluating adversarial attacks.\n\n5.  **Results and Discussion:**\n\n    *   PGD was found to be more effective than ASMA in multi-class segmentation.  This suggests that the ASMA approach, which was originally designed for binary segmentation, may not generalize well to more complex scenarios.\n    *   The ASMA attack resulted in larger, more visible perturbations (higher L2 norm) compared to PGD, indicating a trade-off between attack success and stealth.\n\n**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Focus on Attack, Not Defense:** The paper *primarily* focuses on *attacking* image segmentation models. It does not explicitly propose or evaluate any defenses. Therefore, the information is indirectly relevant to understanding adversarial robustness, but it does not offer solutions or analyze the effectiveness of existing defense mechanisms.\n*   **Limited Scope:** The paper only investigates two specific attack methods (PGD and ASMA) and two specific architectures (DeepLabV3 with MobileNetV3 and ResNet50 backbones). The trends observed might not generalize to all possible attack methods or architectures.\n*   **Pascal Dataset:** The models were trained on the Pascal Dataset.\n*   **Implementation Details:** Convergence for ASMA is reached with \u03c4 = 1e _\u2212_ 5, \u03b2 = 3e _\u2212_ 6 for the MobileNetV3 architecture, while \u03c4 = 1e _\u2212_ 5, \u03b2 = 1e _\u2212_ 4 for the ResNet50 architecture, while \u03b5 = 0.1 and \u03b1 = 100 is used based on previous implementations for the PGD attacks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis paper contributes to the understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities in image segmentation models.  While it does not directly address robustness *techniques*, it provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different attack strategies, the impact of architecture choice, and the importance of evaluating adversarial attacks using appropriate metrics. The comparison of PGD and ASMA highlights the potential challenges in generalizing attack methods across different problem settings (binary vs. multi-class segmentation). Understanding the limitations of various attacks is also critical for developing more robust defenses."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed extraction of relevant information from the provided paper:\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper introduces a **novel adversarial attack method** that uses **natural language to induce adversarial images**.  Instead of directly manipulating pixels (as in traditional adversarial attacks), this method crafts adversarial *prompts* for text-to-image models (like Midjourney, DALL-E) to generate images that fool classifiers.\n\n**Why this is relevant to adversarial robustness (even though it's an attack paper):**\n\n*   Understanding how models can be fooled is crucial for developing more robust models. This paper explores a new *attack surface* \u2013 the intersection of natural language and image generation \u2013 which highlights previously unconsidered vulnerabilities.\n*   The identified vulnerabilities aren't just about noise or pixel-level perturbations; they relate to *semantic information* expressed in natural language.\n\n**Key Methodological Details:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Prompt Optimization:** The core of the method is optimizing the text prompts given to the text-to-image model. Because these prompts involve discrete word choices, the authors use an **adaptive genetic algorithm (GA)**, which doesn't require gradients. This is important because many commercial text-to-image models are \"black boxes.\"\n*   **Adaptive Word Space Reduction:** To improve query efficiency (especially important when using commercial models with query limits), they use an adaptive word space reduction method. This prunes the vocabulary used in prompts, focusing the search on more promising terms.\n*   **CLIP for Semantic Consistency:** The CLIP model is used to ensure that the generated adversarial images retain semantic consistency with the intended target class (even while being adversarial).\n*   **Prompt Structure:** The paper uses a customizable prompt structure like: _\u201c<number><color>[target animal] <appearance>is <gesture>on the <background>on a <weather>day, the [target animal] faces forward, the [target animal] occupies the main part in this scene, viewed <viewangle>.\u201d_\n\n**Key Findings/Trends Highlighted:**\n\n1.  **Semantic Vulnerabilities:** The research demonstrates that specific, high-frequency semantic information (expressed in language) can easily cause classifier errors. Examples include:\n    *   Weather conditions: \"foggy,\" \"humid\"\n    *   Actions: \"stretching\"\n    *   Colors: \"green\"\n    *   Appearance: \"wearing clothes,\" \"wearing a pair of glasses\"\n2.  **Real-World Relevance:**  The authors found that these adversarial semantic elements are not just theoretical; they also exist in real-world photos and can cause misclassifications in those contexts.\n3.  **Transferability:**\n    *   The adversarial prompts and the resulting adversarial images *transfer* across different text-to-image models (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.).\n    *   The adversarial images transfer across different image classifiers (ResNet, ViT, VGG, etc.), even including adversarially trained classifiers.\n    *   Adversarial semantic information can be transferred to unseen classification tasks (zero-shot attack).\n4.  **Physical World Robustness:** The adversarial images, when printed and recaptured by a camera, still exhibit adversarial behavior, suggesting some robustness to physical-world perturbations.\n5.  **Social Impact:** The research highlights potential fairness issues, as the same techniques can be used to generate adversarial images that lead to misclassification based on race.\n6. Adaptive Word Space Reduction (AWSR) significantly reduced the number of queries (from 201 to 127) while keeping a high ASR\n\n**Why is this paper important to the Research Question?**\n\n*   **New Attack Vector:** It showcases a move from pixel-level attacks to semantic-level attacks.  Instead of directly manipulating the image, the vulnerability lies in the model's understanding of language and its ability to generate images that exploit biases in image classifiers.\n*   **Focus on Natural Conditions:** It attempts to understand how models fail under \"natural conditions,\" making the attacks more realistic and relevant.\n*   **Black-Box Setting:** The method is designed to work in black-box settings, which is increasingly important as more models are deployed as services without exposing their internal workings.\n*   **Transferability:**  The transferability of the attacks emphasizes that vulnerabilities are not specific to individual models but can be more general.\n\n**Limitations (that also point to future research):**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on *attacking* image classifiers.  While it demonstrates the vulnerability, it doesn't deeply explore specific *defenses* against these language-induced attacks.  However, by highlighting the problem, it implicitly calls for research into defenses.\n*   While the paper notes some transferability, a more thorough analysis of the factors that influence transferability would be valuable.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper is highly relevant to the research question. It highlights a cutting-edge trend in adversarial attacks: using natural language to craft semantic-level perturbations that fool image classifiers. This trend is important because it shifts the focus from low-level pixel manipulations to higher-level semantic vulnerabilities, demanding new approaches to adversarial robustness. The paper's findings regarding transferability and real-world relevance further underscore the importance of this emerging area."

It aims to protect image data from being exposed to cloud providers during classification tasks. However, the encryption methods discussed *do* offer some robustness against certain attacks, so there's a tangential connection. The paper does not explicitly discuss trends in adversarial robustness against adversarial examples.\n\n**Key Information Related to Robustness (Indirectly):**\n\n*   **Encryption as a Defense:** The paper positions image encryption (specifically block-wise scrambling) as a method to achieve a degree of robustness. The abstract states \"Block-wise scrambled images, which are robust enough against various attacks...\" This suggests that the encrypted images are more resistant to certain attacks compared to plain images. However, the types of attacks are not explicitly adversarial attacks.\n*   **Weaknesses of Existing Encryption:** The paper highlights that earlier image encoding approaches like GAN-based methods ([16], from 2021) although achieving high classification accuracy, are \"not robust against some attacks\" ([19], from 2021). This implicitly acknowledges the need for robustness. It also mentions that pixel-wise encryption (PE) methods are not robust against ciphertext-only attacks, according to reports in [19] and [20].\n*   **Block-wise Scrambling:** Block-wise scrambled images are mentioned as being more robust against various attacks than other encryption methods. The challenge, however, is mitigating the impact of encryption on classification accuracy.\n*   **Adaptive Networks (Prior Work):** Previous methods ([14], [15]) used \"adaptation networks\" in conjunction with classifiers to reduce the negative impact of encryption on accuracy. However, these networks are computationally expensive (many parameters) and don't scale well to large images.\n*   **Proposed Approach:** The paper proposes a novel block-wise encryption method combined with a ConvMixer architecture and an \"adaptive permutation matrix.\" The adaptive permutation matrix is trainable. The key idea is to make the network learn to undo or compensate for the scrambling introduced by the encryption. The goal is to maintain high classification accuracy on encrypted images while providing privacy.\n*   **Specific Encryption Steps:**\n\n    1.  Divide the image into M x M blocks.\n    2.  Permutate the blocks randomly using secret key K1.\n    3.  Apply pixel shuffling within each block using secret key K2 (common to all blocks).\n    4.  Apply negative-positive transformation to each pixel using secret key K3 (common to all blocks).\n    5.  Concatenate the blocks to form the encrypted image.\n*   **ConvMixer's Advantages:**\n    *   Patch-based operation reduces the influence of block-wise encryption without needing block-wise sub-networks.\n    *   Patch embedding can adapt to pixel shuffling.\n*   **Experimental Results (CIFAR-10):** The proposed method (ConvMixer with adaptive permutation matrix) achieves the highest classification accuracy on encrypted images compared to the EtC ([21]) and ELE ([15]) methods. Without the permutation matrix, the accuracy decreases by approximately 3%.\n\n**Limitations/Caveats:**\n\n*   **Privacy vs. Adversarial Robustness:** The paper *does not* directly address adversarial robustness in the sense of defending against specifically crafted adversarial examples (small, intentional perturbations to images). The robustness mentioned refers to the difficulty of an attacker recovering the original image or gleaning information from the encrypted image.\n*   **Attack Types:** The paper lacks detail on the specific types of attacks the encryption is robust against. It mentions ciphertext-only attacks in the context of *other* methods being vulnerable.\n*   **Evaluation:** The experiments are limited to the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n*   **Dates:** All references are before November 2024, and thus within the last 2 years.\n\n**Relevant References (within the last 2 years):**\n\n*   [2] H.

Understanding which architectures are inherently more robust is a crucial trend.",
      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed breakdown of the provided paper, focusing on information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Overview and Scope**\n\nThe paper investigates the relationship between architectural design and adversarial robustness generalization. The authors evaluate various adversarially trained architectures on image classification tasks, focusing on Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The core issue addressed is the \"adversarially robust generalization problem,\" which is the gap between training and testing robustness, especially against unseen adversarial attacks.\n\n**Key Findings and Trends (Relevant to the Research Question)**\n\n*   **Transformers vs. CNNs:**\n    *   The paper suggests that Vision Transformers (e.g., PVT, CoAtNet) often exhibit better adversarially robust generalization compared to CNNs under aligned settings.\n    *   CNNs, on the other hand, tend to overfit on specific attacks used during training (e.g., \u2113\u221e attacks) and fail to generalize well on multiple adversaries (e.g., \u21131 and \u21132 attacks).\n    *   This contradicts earlier findings.\n\n*   **Weight Sparsity:**\n    *   A key theoretical finding is that higher weight sparsity contributes significantly to the improved adversarially robust generalization of Transformers.\n    *   This sparsity is often achieved through the use of attention blocks in Transformer architectures.\n\n*   **Architectural Design Matters:**\n    *   The research emphasizes that architectural design has a strong correlation with adversarially robust generalization.\n    *   Different architectural choices can result in significant differences in robustness (e.g., up to 20% or more).\n\n*   **Impact of Attention Mechanisms:**\n    *   The paper indicates that attention layers contribute to weight sparsity in Transformers, leading to better robustness.\n    *   Specifically, the QKV (Query, Key, Value) weights in attention layers have higher sparsity compared to weights in convolutional layers.\n\n*   **\u21131 Regularization:**\n    *   The paper explored the effect of imposing \u21131 regularization during adversarial training to explicitly improve sparsity.\n    *   While \u21131 regularization can improve adversarially robust generalization to some extent, the improvement is not as substantial as the differences observed between Transformers and CNNs due to architectural design. There can be also a trade-off between the accuracy of clean samples, and the adversarial robustness.\n\n*   **Patch Size Impact:**\n    *   The paper shows that smaller patch sizes in Transformers can lead to better accuracy on clean examples and on the specific attacks that are trained on. However, it can hurt the ability to generalize to other attacks (e.g., PGD-\u21131 and PGD-\u21132). This is because decreasing the patch size makes the model behave more like CNNs that are more likely to overfit on trained adversarial examples.\n\n**Experimental Setup and Evaluation Metrics**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CIFAR-10 and ImageNette (subset of ImageNet). Experiments were also conducted on ImageNet to validate findings on a larger dataset.\n*   **Architectures:** A comprehensive set of 20 adversarially trained architectures, including ViT, MLP-Mixer, PoolFormer, Swin Transformer, ViTAE, CCT, MobileViT, CPVT, BoTNet, CeiT, CoAtNet, CvT, LeViT, PVTv2, ResNet, ResNeXt, WideResNet, PreActResNet, VGG, and DenseNet.\n*   **Adversarial Training:** Standard PGD-\u2113\u221e adversarial training was used.\n*   **Attacks:** Evaluation included PGD-\u21131, PGD-\u21132, PGD-\u2113\u221e, and AutoAttack-\u2113\u221e attacks.\n*   **Metrics:** Classification accuracy on clean examples and sample-wise worst-case robust accuracy (lower bound for robustness under multiple adversarial attacks).\n\n**Theoretical Analysis**\n\n*   Rademacher complexity is used to analyze the generalization error. The analysis suggests that imposing an \u21131 norm constraint on the weight matrix leads to a sparser weight matrix, reducing the Rademacher complexity of adversarial training.\n\n**Potential Future Directions**\n\n*   Designing architectural ingredients that promote weight sparsity (e.g., attention layers).\n*   Exploring hybrid architectures that combine attention and convolution while maximizing sparsity.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n*   The generalization of different adversarially trained architectures towards common corruptions and clean examples is still ambiguous, indicating that there are many factors influencing robustness on common corruptions (e.g., datasets, input size).\n\n**Relevance to the Last 2 Years**\n\nThe paper was submitted in 2023, and it cites papers mostly from 2018-2022. Given the research question's requirement of considering papers from the last 2 years (2022-2024), it's important to focus on findings and trends that are confirmed or expanded upon by the more recent citations within this paper. The paper cites the following papers published in the last two years:\n*   **Liu et al. (2023)**: This paper is from the authors themselves.\n*   **Ma et al. (2022)**\n*   **Wei et al. (2022)**\n*   **Zhao et al. (2023)**\n\n**Summary of Trends**\n\nBased on the paper and its recent citations, some of the trends in adversarial robustness for image classification are:\n\n1.  **Architectural focus:** Shifting towards understanding how different neural network architectures impact adversarial robustness, particularly the comparison between Transformers and CNNs.\n2.  **Exploiting sparsity:** Leveraging weight sparsity as a key factor in improving robustness, often achieved through attention mechanisms.\n3.  **Generalization across attacks:** Moving beyond robustness against specific attacks to improve generalization across diverse and unseen adversarial perturbations.\n4.  **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Developing more robust and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating adversarial robustness, considering both adversarial attacks and common corruptions."

      "summary": "Okay, let's extract the relevant information from this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**I. Core Idea and Contribution of the Paper (within the scope of the research question)**\n\n*   **Defense Transformers:** The paper proposes a novel approach called \"Defense Transformers\" to enhance adversarial robustness in image classification. The core idea is to \"counterattack\" adversarial examples by pulling them back to the original clean data distribution using affine transformations. This contrasts with existing methods that focus on specific attack types or rely on random transformations/denoising.\n\n*   **Affine Transformations:** The paper argues that adversarial examples are often located near the classification boundary and are therefore vulnerable to affine transformations (rotation, scaling, translation).  It theoretically and empirically verifies the existence of \"defense affine transformations\" that can restore adversarial examples.\n\n*   **Parameterizing Transformations:** The Defense Transformer uses a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) to parameterize the affine transformations, guided by a U-Net architecture.  The U-Net helps to perturb adversarial examples to a proper position where STN can parameterize affine transformation.\n\n*   **Generalization:** A key claim is that this approach generalizes well to different types of adversarial examples (linear and non-linear), different attack intensities, and even unseen attacks over different models.\n\n**II. Relevant Trends and Techniques (from the paper and its cited works, and filtered by the \"last 2 years\" criterion)**\n\nThe paper implicitly positions itself within the trend of using transformations for adversarial defense, while also highlighting limitations of other approaches.  Let's dig into specific trends and techniques it mentions, with a focus on the last 2 years (2022-2024, given the paper's context):\n\n*   **Transformation-Based Defenses:**  The paper acknowledges transformation-based methods as a significant area of research.  It classifies these into:\n\n    *   **Random Transformation Methods:**  These methods use a combination of random transformations (e.g., cropping, rotations) to disrupt adversarial perturbations. The paper cites `Cropping-ensemble [7]` and `BaRT [25]` as examples of this approach. A key limitation the paper identifies is the randomness, which makes it difficult to reliably guide adversarial examples back to the clean data distribution.\n\n    *   **Denoising Methods:** These methods aim to remove the noise introduced by adversarial attacks.  `HGD [16]` and `Feature Denoising [35]` are cited as examples. The paper argues that these methods are less effective against adversarial examples *not* generated by specific types of noise or when the attack range is large.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training:**  Although not the focus, the paper mentions adversarial training as another major class of defense methods.  This involves training DNNs with adversarial examples to make them more robust.  The paper cites `Adversarial logit pairing [10]` as an adversarial training method.\n*   **Mixup Inference:** The paper discusses `Mixup inference [24]` which interpolates a sample between an adversarial example and other random clean samples to make predictions.\n\n*   **White-box Attack Awareness:** The paper acknowledges the challenge of defending against white-box attacks, where the attacker knows the exact defense mechanism. They observe that both their method and HGD are vulnerable to such attacks.\n\n**III. Specific Papers Mentioned (with potential relevance, and a check against the \"last 2 years\" criterion).**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the cited papers, checking if they fall within the last 2 years (2022-2024):\n\n*   **Within the Last 2 Years (Likely Ineligible):** Given the likely publication date of the paper, it is highly probable that any papers published in 2022, 2023, or 2024 are not included in the list.

Summarized Trends based on the paper**\n\nGiven the above, we can summarize the following trends, while acknowledging the limitations of this single paper as a data source:\n\n1.  **Transformation-based Defenses are a prominent research area:**  This includes random transformations and denoising methods. The focus is on manipulating the input data to mitigate the effect of adversarial perturbations.\n\n2.  **Generalization is a Key Challenge:**  A major focus is on developing defenses that generalize well to different types of attacks, attack intensities, and even unseen models. Many existing defenses are tailored to specific attack types and fail to generalize.\n\n3.  **White-box Attack Robustness is Difficult:** Defending against attackers who have full knowledge of the defense mechanism remains a significant challenge.\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n\nThis paper contributes to the trend of transformation-based defenses by proposing a \"Defense Transformer\" that learns affine transformations to restore adversarial examples. It highlights the limitations of random transformation and denoising methods, and emphasizes the importance of generalization. The paper acknowledges that defense against white-box attacks remains a challenging open problem."

      "relevancy": "This paper introduces DUCD, a privacy-preserving universal adversarial defense for black-box models, which is relevant to adversarial robustness for image classification and was published in 2024, so it falls within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this paper and extract the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Privacy-preserving Universal Adversarial Defense for Black-box Models\n\n**Key Areas & Findings Related to Adversarial Robustness (Last 2 Years):**\n\n1.  **Focus on Black-Box Models:** A significant trend is the increasing focus on adversarial robustness in black-box settings. Traditional defenses often require white-box access (model parameters, architecture, training data), which raises privacy concerns.  This paper addresses the need for defenses that work without such access, aligning with a growing trend of privacy-preserving machine learning. The paper specifically identifies that recent studies aim to provide provable robustness in black-box scenarios where defenders have limited information from model owners.\n\n2.  **Universal Defense (Model-Agnostic and Norm-Universal):** The paper highlights the importance of *universal* defenses, meaning defenses that are both:\n    *   **Model-Agnostic:** Can be applied to *any* target model without prior knowledge of its architecture or parameters.\n    *   **Norm-Universal:** Provide provable robustness against attacks across different *\u2113p*-norms (e.g., *\u2113*1, *\u2113*2, *\u2113*\u221e).  The *\u2113p*-norm defines how the \"size\" or magnitude of the adversarial perturbation is measured. Different attacks might exploit vulnerabilities more effectively under different norms. So, a truly robust defense should be effective against all of them. The paper emphasizes that achieving both model-agnosticism and norm-universality simultaneously is a challenging goal.\n\n3.  **Certified Defenses:** The paper falls under the category of *certified defenses*. These defenses aim to provide *provable* guarantees of robustness.  They establish a \"certified radius\" around an input, within which adversarial attacks *cannot* successfully change the model's prediction. This is in contrast to *empirical defenses* (e.g., adversarial training) which can be effective but lack formal guarantees and are often susceptible to adaptive attacks.\n\n4.  **Randomized Smoothing:**  The paper leverages *randomized smoothing* as a core technique for certified defense.  Randomized smoothing involves adding random noise to the input and then averaging the predictions. This smoothing effect makes the model less sensitive to small perturbations. The paper contrasts this with *denoised smoothing* which they argue is less flexible and offers a lower certified radius.\n\n5.  **Distillation-Based Surrogate Models:**  To work in the black-box setting, the paper uses *knowledge distillation*. The idea is to *query* the target black-box model with data to create a *surrogate* white-box model.  This surrogate model mimics the behavior of the target model but can be analyzed and defended using white-box techniques.  The authors design a *target loss function* to align the surrogate model's outputs with the target model, ensuring functional consistency while preserving privacy. The surrogate model then acts as a basis for the certified defense (randomized smoothing).\n\n6.  **Optimized Noise Selection:** The authors optimize the certified radius by treating the input noise in randomized smoothing as a tunable variable. This is a key innovation, as traditional randomized smoothing often relies on fixed noise distributions (e.g., Gaussian).  They perform a grid search to find the best parameters for the noise Probability Density Function (PDF) to maximize the certified radius.  The experiments show that commonly used Laplacian and Gaussian noise are not necessarily optimal across all *\u2113p*-norms.\n\n7.  **Privacy Considerations:** The paper explicitly addresses *privacy* by using knowledge distillation and by showing that their method reduces the success rate of membership inference attacks. This is important as defenses themselves can sometimes leak information about the training data.\n\n8.  **Evaluation Metrics:**  The paper uses standard metrics for evaluating certified robustness:\n    *   *Certified Accuracy:*  The percentage of correctly classified data for which the certified radius exceeds a specified threshold.\n    *   *Robustness Score (Area Under the Curve):* A summary measure of the correlation between certified accuracy and certified radius.\n    *   *Attack Success Rate (ASR):* Quantifies the effectiveness of an attack against a defended model.\n        *   *Purification Success Rate:* Verifies the effectiveness of the purification pass to filter out uncertified inputs.\n\n**Specific Contributions (DUCD - Distillation-based Universal Black-box model Defense):**\n\n*   Practical black-box defense that is model-agnostic, norm-universal, privacy-preserving, and has a high certified radius.\n*   Surrogate model generation using query-based techniques and a targeted loss function.\n*   Optimized certified defense through randomized smoothing.\n*   Demonstrated improvements in certified accuracy compared to existing black-box defenses.\n\n**Related Work (Last 2 Years - but might be older):**\n\n*   **Empirical Defenses (mentioned as context):** Adversarial detection and adversarial training.\n*   **Certified Defenses (key context):**\n    *   Methods based on differential privacy.\n    *   Methods based on randomized smoothing (e.g., Cohen et al. [19]).\n    *   Black-box certified defenses using proxy models.\n\n**Limitations/Future Work:**\n\n*   The paper notes that their method performs poorly against *\u2113*\u221e attacks, even though randomized smoothing should theoretically provide robustness against all norms. This is identified as a critical issue for future research.\n\n**In summary, the paper's findings suggest the following trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (with focus on 2022-2024):**\n\n*   **Growing interest in black-box defense:**  A shift away from white-box assumptions to more realistic scenarios where model details are not available.\n*   **Emphasis on universal robustness:**  Defenses should be effective against a variety of attacks, not just specific ones, and should work across different *\u2113p*-norms.\n*   **Randomized smoothing remains a key technique:** But there's ongoing research on how to optimize it (e.g., noise selection).\n*   **Knowledge distillation for black-box adaptation:** Using queries to create surrogate models that can then be defended.\n*   **Privacy is a growing concern:** Defenses should not compromise the privacy of the training data.\n*   **\u2113\u221e attacks remain a challenge:** Developing defenses that are truly robust under *\u2113*\u221e norms is an open problem."

      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided paper and extracted the information most relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Key Focus:**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on adversarial robustness against **backdoor attacks**, not general adversarial robustness.  It presents a *deterministic certified defense* called **PECAN**, designed to defend against these specific attacks.\n\n**Relevant Information from the Last 2 Years (Approximate, based on reference dates):**\n\nThe trends in adversarial robustness (specifically for backdoor attacks on image classification, and relevant for the last 2 years) highlighted by the paper are:\n\n1.  **Certified Defenses Are Gaining Traction, but Deterministic Approaches Are Emerging:**\n\n    *   The paper positions itself against existing defenses, many of which are *empirical* (i.e., based on experimental results without formal guarantees) or *probabilistic certified defenses.*  The trend is moving toward *certified defenses*, providing mathematical *proofs* of robustness.\n    *   Probabilistic defenses (e.g., BagFlip, Zhang et al., 2022b) exist but are computationally expensive and may require retraining, making them difficult to deploy. The paper argues for and presents a **deterministic** alternative (PECAN). Deterministic defenses (Levine et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b) can reuse trained models an arbitrary number of times when producing certificates for different test inputs.\n    *   PECAN is a **deterministic certified defense**\n\n2.  **Limitations of Existing Certified Defenses:**\n\n    *   Existing *certified defenses* often focus on trigger-less poisoning attacks (Zhu et al., 2019; Shafahi et al., 2018; Levine and Feizi, 2021) or evasion attacks (Madry et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020; Xiang and Mittal, 2021) *separately*.  Backdoor attacks combine both, making them more challenging.\n    *   Specifically, defenses against trigger-less attacks (e.g., DPA - Levine & Feizi, 2021) and against evasion attacks (e.g., CROWN-IBP - Zhang et al., 2020 and PatchGuard++ - Xiang and Mittal, 2021) are insufficient against backdoor attacks.  The paper demonstrates this experimentally by breaking these defenses using BadNets (Gu et al., 2017).\n\n3.  **Ensemble Methods and Data Partitioning are being explored:**\n\n    *   PECAN leverages an *ensemble* of neural networks, each trained on a disjoint partition of the data. This strategy is inspired by Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA, Levine and Feizi, 2021).\n    *   Other approaches like Bagging (Jia et al. 2021; Chen et al., 2020) use ensemble methods for trigger-less attacks.\n\n4.  **Defense Against Explanation-Guided Backdoor Attacks**\n\n    *   XRand (Nguyen et al., 2022) is a certified defense against explanation-guided attacks by leveraging differential privacy, but are probabilistic.\n\n5. **CBD vs PECAN**\n\n    *CBD (Xiang et al, 2023) is a certified backdoor detector that aims to identify whether a trained classifier is backdoored, assuming the defender has access to a small, clean validation set.*\n\n6. **FPA**\n   *FPA (Hammoudeh and Lowd, 2023) employs a deterministic certified defense mechanism that partitions the feature space instead of the dataset.*\n\n7. **Advances in evasion certification techniques**\n   *Complete certification (Zhang et al., 2022a; Katz et al., 2019) and incomplete certification (Zhang et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2019)*\n\n**PECAN's Approach (Key Details):**\n\n*   **Deterministic Certification:** PECAN provides a *deterministic certificate* of robustness against backdoor attacks.\n*   **Evasion Certification as a Component:** It uses off-the-shelf *evasion certification* techniques (like CROWN-IBP, Zhang et al., 2020, or PatchGuard++, Xiang and Mittal, 2021) as a module. This allows it to leverage advances in evasion defense.\n*   **Dataset Partitioning:** PECAN partitions the training data into disjoint subsets. This bounds the influence of poisoned data.\n*   **Aggregation:** It aggregates the results from the ensemble of trained networks and produces a prediction with a robustness certificate (certified radius, toleration of percentage of poisoned data).\n\n**Evaluation Highlights:**\n\n*   PECAN outperforms the state-of-the-art *probabilistic* certified defense (BagFlip, Zhang et al., 2022b) in terms of certified accuracy and efficiency.\n*   It reduces the attack success rate of BadNets (Gu et al., 2017) and explanation-guided backdoor attacks (XBA, Severi et al., 2021) significantly.\n*   It is evaluated on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR10) and malware detection (EMBER) datasets.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work Mentioned:**\n\n*   PECAN currently generates small certified radii for large datasets.\n*   The current implementation with CROWN-IBP works with simpler networks.\n*   Potential improvements could include finite aggregation and run-off election (Wang et al., 2022b; Rezaei et al., 2023).\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (specifically against backdoor attacks, within the last ~2 years) involve a move towards *certified defenses*, with a focus on *deterministic* approaches like PECAN that address the combined challenges of data poisoning and trigger-based attacks. Ensemble methods and data partitioning are key components of these defenses. The paper positions itself against purely empirical defenses and highlights limitations of existing defenses against trigger-less or evasion attacks when applied to the more complex backdoor scenario."

While the focus is on tracking rather than image classification, the analysis of adversarial corruption robustness is relevant to the research question, especially considering it is from this year.",
      "summary": "Here's a detailed extraction of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on adversarial robustness trends in image classification within the last 2 years.\n\n**Overall Relevance to the Research Question:**\n\nThe paper \"Benchmarking the Robustness of UAV Tracking Against Common Corruptions\" is *partially* relevant to the research question. While it doesn't directly address adversarial robustness in *image classification* in general, it *does* investigate the robustness of *UAV tracking* algorithms against various *corruptions*, including some that could be considered adversarial in nature (or at least, degrade performance in a similar way).  Furthermore, the paper references and draws inspiration from work done on image classification robustness benchmarks (like ImageNet-C), making the underlying concepts applicable.\n\n**Key Information Extracted (with a focus on potential relevance to image classification robustness trends):**\n\n1.  **Focus on Robustness Under Corruptions:** The core theme is evaluating the *robustness* of UAV tracking algorithms when faced with various types of data corruption.  This aligns with the broader goal of adversarial robustness, which aims to make models resistant to malicious or unexpected input changes.\n\n2.  **Types of Corruptions Considered:** The paper categorizes corruptions into four main types:\n    *   **Weather:** Fog, Rain, Snow, Frost, and Spatter.  (These are less directly related to *adversarial* attacks, but important for real-world robustness).\n    *   **Sensor:** Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, Impulse noise, Speckle noise, and Low Contrast. (Noise is a common element in studies of adversarial robustness, even if these aren't strictly \"adversarial\" examples.)\n    *   **Blur:** Defocus, Motion, Zoom, and Gaussian Blur. (Blur can be a byproduct or a component of certain adversarial attacks or data imperfections.)\n    *   **Composite:** Dual Interaction Fusion (DIF) and Tri-Interaction Synthesis (TIS) corruptions (combinations of weather, sensor, and blur).  (The study of *combined* corruptions is relevant because real-world attacks or data imperfections might involve multiple factors.)\n\n3.  **UAV-C Benchmark:** The paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called UAV-C specifically for evaluating UAV tracking robustness under these corruptions.  While this isn't an image classification dataset, the *methodology* of creating a benchmark with controlled corruptions is a trend applicable to image classification.\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Tracking Algorithms:** The authors evaluate 12 tracking algorithms on UAV-C.  These algorithms are categorized as:\n    *   CNN-based (SiamAPN++, SiamBAN, SiamRPN++, KeepTrack)\n    *   CNN-Transformer-based (ToMP, HIFT, TCTrack, TransT, STARK, SGD)\n    *   Transformer-based (Aba-ViTrack, OSTrack)\n\n    The *relative performance* of these architectures under corruption could be informative, especially the performance of Transformer-based architectures, as Transformers are a dominant trend in both image classification and tracking.\n\n5.  **Performance Degradation:** A key finding is that the performance of all tested trackers *degrades* significantly in the presence of corruptions. This reinforces the importance of robustness research.  The paper notes: \"For example, the performance of state-of-the-art OSTrack is dropped from 69.3% to 56.0% in mScor.\"\n\n6.  **Specific Corruption Impact:**  The paper identifies \"Zoom Blur\" as the most challenging corruption, causing the largest average performance drop (72.9%). Composite corruptions also have a significant impact.  This highlights that certain types of distortions are more difficult to defend against.\n\n7.  **Tracker-Specific Vulnerabilities:** The study finds that different trackers exhibit different sensitivities to specific types of corruptions. This implies that defense strategies might need to be tailored to specific architectures or algorithms.\n\n8.  **Potential Mitigation Strategies (Discussion Section):**\n    *   **Corruption Contrastive Learning:** The authors suggest using contrastive learning to improve the similarity between clean and corrupted samples, thereby enhancing robustness.  Contrastive learning is a significant trend in representation learning and has applications in adversarial robustness.\n    *   **Temporal Consistency:** For video tracking (and potentially relevant to video classification), the paper suggests maintaining temporal consistency in feature representations to mitigate the accumulation of errors.  Temporal modeling is also used in defending against video-based adversarial attacks.\n\n9.  **References to Image Classification Robustness:** The paper *explicitly* mentions and draws inspiration from the ImageNet-C benchmark [10]:  \"Drawing inspiration from methodologies like ImageNet-C [10], initially introduced for image classification, this approach introduces 15 corruption types encompassing factors such as noise, blur, weather, and digital corruption.\" This acknowledgement connects the work to the broader field of image classification robustness.

This approach, pioneered by ImageNet-C, is now being extended to other tasks like UAV tracking.\n*   **Importance of Transformers:** The paper's findings suggest that Transformer-based architectures might be more resilient to certain types of corruptions, aligning with the broader trend of Transformers dominating various computer vision tasks, including those requiring robustness.\n*   **Contrastive Learning as a Mitigation Strategy:** The suggestion of using corruption contrastive learning aligns with the trend of using contrastive learning methods to improve robustness.\n*   **Emphasis on Real-World Corruptions:** The focus on realistic corruptions (weather, sensor noise, blur) reflects a move towards evaluating robustness in more practical scenarios, rather than just against abstract adversarial perturbations.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   **UAV Tracking vs. Image Classification:** The paper's primary focus is UAV tracking, *not* image classification. Therefore, the results may not directly translate.\n*   **Specific Corruptions:** The specific types of corruptions considered might not be fully representative of all adversarial attack types used in image classification.\n\n**In conclusion:** While this paper doesn't directly present advancements in adversarial robustness for *image classification*, it offers valuable insights into how to *evaluate* and potentially *improve* the robustness of computer vision systems against data corruptions. The trends it highlights (benchmark datasets, Transformer architectures, contrastive learning) are all relevant to the broader field of adversarial robustness in image classification. The methodology for creating the benchmark, and the types of corruptions explored can be used as inspiration for image classification tasks."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the paper's content relevant to the research question, focusing on image classification and recent trends (last 2 years - considering this paper was written in 2023 based on the references).\n\n**Research Question:** What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for *image classification*? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\n\n**Overview of the Paper's Approach**\n\nThis paper focuses on improving the robustness of neural networks against both *adversarial attacks* and *common corruptions*. The core idea is to use an **adversarial contrastive learning framework**.\n\n**Key elements of the proposed framework:**\n\n1.  **Adversarial Example Generation:** The method generates instance-wise adversarial examples. It introduces perturbations to augmentations of the samples to maximize their contrastive loss.\n2.  **Contrastive Learning:**  It enhances the similarity between clean samples and their adversarial counterparts using contrastive learning.  This aims to create representations that are resistant to adversarial perturbations *and* common corruptions.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question:**\n\nThe paper *indirectly* touches on the trends in adversarial robustness for image classification by proposing a *novel training framework*. While it doesn't explicitly survey the latest trends, it *implicitly* positions itself within the context of existing approaches, aiming to improve upon them.\n\n**Specific Information Relevant to Trends (based on the paper's context and references):**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training Remains a Core Strategy:** The paper builds upon the established technique of *adversarial training*, where adversarial examples are used to augment the training dataset. However, it acknowledges that standard adversarial training alone is often insufficient. *This suggests a trend of researchers looking for ways to enhance or augment adversarial training.*  The paper cites Madry et al. (2018) as a key work in adversarial training, but also references work that shows its limitations.\n*   **Focus on Latent Representations:**  The paper mentions that recent studies are focusing on the *susceptibility of latent representations* as a primary factor in adversarial vulnerability. The TRADES approach (Zhang et al., 2019), which employs Kullback-Leibler divergence to manipulate the decision boundary, is mentioned as an example of this trend. *This indicates a trend of researchers trying to make the feature space more robust.*\n*   **Contrastive Learning for Robustness:** A significant trend highlighted in the paper is the use of *contrastive self-supervised learning* to improve robustness.  The paper cites works (Tian et al., 2020a; Chen et al., 2020c; He et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020b) demonstrating that contrastive learning can achieve comparable performance to fully-supervised models and improve robustness. The paper also specifically cites (Hendrycks et al., 2019) which directly demonstrates that self-supervision improves robustness. The proposed method leverages this by combining adversarial training with contrastive learning.  *This suggests a growing interest in using self-supervised and contrastive learning techniques to enhance adversarial robustness.*\n*   **Addressing Common Corruptions:**  The paper emphasizes the importance of robustness against *common corruptions* (blur, noise, weather effects, etc.) in addition to adversarial attacks.  The paper uses the Common Corruptions benchmark (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method. *This indicates a trend of researchers moving beyond just adversarial attacks and considering real-world distortions.*\n*   **Beyond Defenses that Obfuscate Gradients:** The paper notes Athalye et al. (2018a) showed that many defenses appear robust only because they mask out the gradients, and proposed new types of attacks that circumvent gradient obfuscation. *This highlights the importance of evaluating against strong attacks, and not relying on defenses that simply hide gradients.*\n*   **Data Augmentation:** The papers explores using adversarial training examples as a form of data augmentation.\n\n**Specific References within the Last 2 Years (at the time of writing - 2023):**\n\n*   **Chen et al., 2021:** \"Robust and Accurate Object Detection via Adversarial Learning.\" (CVPR).  This paper extends adversarial training to object detection, showing that adversarial learning can improve object detection accuracy and robustness.\n*   **Kotyan & Vargas, 2022:** \"Adversarial robustness assessment: Why in evaluation both L0 and L8 attacks are necessary.\" This paper stresses the need for comprehensive evaluation using different types of adversarial attacks.\n*   **Pei et al., 2022:** \"Towards Practical Verification of Machine Learning: The Case of Computer Vision Systems\". This paper considers real-world image corruptions.\n\n**Summary of Trends Based on the Paper:**\n\n1.  **Enhanced Adversarial Training:** Moving beyond basic adversarial training to more sophisticated techniques that address its limitations.\n2.  **Latent Space Robustness:** Focusing on making the learned feature representations more resilient to perturbations.\n3.  **Contrastive Learning:** Leveraging contrastive learning methods to improve robustness through self-supervision.\n4.  **Real-World Corruptions:**  Considering robustness against common image corruptions in addition to adversarial attacks.\n5.  **Strong Attack Evaluation:** Ensuring defenses are evaluated against adaptive and strong attacks.\n\n**Limitations of the Paper in Answering the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Focus on Object Detection:** The paper's experiments are primarily on object detection, not image classification directly.  However, the underlying principles of adversarial robustness are relevant to both tasks.\n*   **Indirect Assessment of Trends:** The paper doesn't explicitly survey or compare different adversarial robustness techniques; it mainly introduces a new method.\n*   **Reference Date:** Some references may be slightly older than 2 years, but they provide necessary background and context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper's primary contribution is a proposed method, it provides valuable insights into the current trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, particularly the shift towards contrastive learning, latent space manipulation, and real-world corruption considerations."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the provided paper to address your research question, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification within the last 2 years:\n\n**Overview of the Paper**\n\nThe paper introduces a \"Double Visual Defense\" framework to improve the adversarial robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically CLIP and LLaVA, against visual perturbations.  The core idea is to perform adversarial training during both the CLIP pre-training phase and the LLaVA instruction tuning phase.  The resulting models, \u2206CLIP and \u2206[2]LLaVA, demonstrate enhanced zero-shot robustness and achieve state-of-the-art results in adversarial defense for VLMs.\n\n**Key Findings and Contributions (Relevant to the Research Question)**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training at All Phases:** The paper emphasizes a shift *away* from lightweight, post-hoc adversarial fine-tuning (like TeCoA and FARE) towards a strategy of adversarial training at *all* phases of VLM development: web-scale CLIP pre-training and LLaVA instruction tuning.  This is presented as a crucial trend.\n\n*   **Double Visual Defense (\u2206[2]LLaVA):** The primary contribution is the \"Double Visual Defense\" approach. This involves:\n\n    1.  **Adversarial Contrastive Pre-training (\u2206CLIP):** Training CLIP on web-scale data with adversarial examples designed to cause incorrect image-text pairings. The resulting \u2206CLIP model learns to defend against visual attacks while maintaining image-text embedding alignment.\n    2.  **Adversarial Visual Instruction Tuning (\u2206[2]LLaVA):** Further strengthening robustness by incorporating adversarial training into the visual instruction tuning stage of LLaVA. This involves training on images perturbed to induce next-token mispredictions in the language model.\n\n*   **Superior Robustness:** The resulting \u2206CLIP and \u2206[2]LLaVA models demonstrate significantly improved robustness compared to previous approaches, without substantial drops in clean data performance. For example, \u2206CLIP shows a substantial robustness improvement on ImageNet-1k compared to previous models, and \u2206[2]LLaVA brings robustness improvements to image captioning and visual question answering tasks.\n\n*   **First Adversarial Visual Instruction Tuning:** The paper claims to be the first to propose and implement adversarial visual instruction tuning. This is a notable trend because it directly targets the vulnerability of instruction-following VLMs.\n\n*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The models are evaluated on a broad range of datasets (over 20) and across different evaluation setups, providing a holistic understanding of the VLMs' capabilities.\n\n**Specific Results Highlighted in the Abstract/Introduction**\n\n*   \u2206CLIP surpasses the adversarial robustness of previous best models on ImageNet-1k by approximately 20%.\n*   \u2206[2]LLaVA brings approximately 30% robustness improvement to image captioning and approximately 20% improvement to visual question answering compared to prior art.\n*   \u2206[2]LLaVA hallucinates less compared to LLaVA models based on previous robust CLIP models like TeCoA or FARE.\n\n**Methodology Details (Relevant to Implementation)**\n\n*   **Adversarial Training Formulation:** The paper provides the standard minimax formulation of adversarial training (Equation 1).\n*   **Adversarial Contrastive Learning for CLIP:** The CLIP contrastive loss is modified to incorporate adversarial examples (Equation 3).\n*   **Adversarial Instruction Tuning for LLaVA:** The standard LLaVA autoregressive loss is modified to include adversarial perturbations (Equation 5).\n*   **Training Details:**\n    *   \u2206CLIP is trained on DataComp-1B with synthetic captions.\n    *   A staged training process is used, increasing the input image size and the number of PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) iterations.\n    *   Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is used for training \u2206[2]LLaVA to reduce computational cost.\n    *   Different attack radii (epsilon values) and PGD iterations are used for the adversarial training.\n    *   The learning rate of the vision encoder is kept at 20% of the base learning rate in adversarial fine-tuning.\n\n**Comparison to Existing Methods (TeCoA and FARE)**\n\nThe paper consistently positions its \"Double Visual Defense\" as superior to previous approaches like TeCoA and FARE.  The key criticisms of these prior methods are:\n\n*   **Lightweight Fine-tuning:** TeCoA and FARE rely on lightweight, post-hoc adversarial fine-tuning of a pre-trained CLIP model, typically on ImageNet.\n*   **Overfitting:** This lightweight fine-tuning is prone to overfitting to ImageNet, hindering zero-shot recognition and generalization ability.\n*   **Performance Drops:** TeCoA and FARE suffer from significant performance drops on uncorrupted inputs, reducing their overall usefulness.\n*   **Hallucination:** TeCoA- and FARE-based LLaVAs are more prone to generating irrelevant outputs (hallucinations).\n\nThe paper provides specific performance comparisons (in tables) showing that \u2206CLIP and \u2206[2]LLaVA achieve better robustness and maintain better clean data performance than TeCoA and FARE.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe paper acknowledges a limitation: it focuses solely on the robustness of CLIP-based models against *visual* adversarial attacks.  Text-based threats and other VLM architectures are left for future research.\n\n**Overall Trends**\n\nBased on this paper, key trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, particularly in the context of VLMs, include:\n\n1.  **End-to-End Adversarial Training:** Moving away from post-hoc fine-tuning to adversarial training throughout the entire model development pipeline (pre-training and instruction tuning).\n2.  **Adversarial Instruction Tuning:** Recognizing and addressing the specific vulnerabilities of instruction-following VLMs through adversarial training during the instruction tuning phase.\n3.  **Balancing Robustness and Clean Performance:**  Focus on maintaining or improving clean data performance while enhancing robustness, addressing a key limitation of earlier adversarial defense methods.\n\n**Important Note:**\nThe other papers cited in this paper would also be relevant but have not been assessed here."

General Trends and Challenges:**\n\n*   **Adversarial Vulnerability:** The paper acknowledges the ongoing challenge of adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks (DNNs) as a major security concern in computer vision systems. This vulnerability is not new but remains an active area of research.\n\n*   **Adversarial Attacks and Defenses:** The field is characterized by a continuous development of new adversarial attack methods and corresponding defense strategies. The paper mentions several attack types (FGSM, PGD, AutoAttack) and defense types(Adversarial Training, Regularization methods, Misclassification aware training)\n\n*   **Effective Margin Maximization:** A central trend is the focus on maximizing the \"effective margin\" of DNNs as a means to improve adversarial robustness. The effective margin represents the normalized logit difference between the ground-truth class and the closest other class.\n\n*   **Regularization Techniques:** Regularization is a prominent trend. The paper highlights various regularization approaches designed to make DNNs more robust.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training (AT) is standard:** AT is recognized as the standard method for training adversarially robust DNNs.

Specific Trends/Methods Discussed in the Paper (within the last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Effective Margin Regularization (EMR):**\n\n    *   **Core Idea:** The paper introduces EMR as a novel approach that regularizes the effective weight norm during training. The goal is to push the decision boundary away from training samples, thus increasing the effective margin and boosting adversarial robustness.\n    *   **Scale-Variant Property of Cross-Entropy Loss:** EMR addresses the scale-variant property of cross-entropy loss, where simply increasing weight norms to minimize loss doesn't necessarily maximize the effective margin.\n    *   **Combination with AT:** EMR is designed to be complementary to adversarial training. It can be combined with AT to further improve robustness.\n    *   **Approximation for Large-Scale Models:** The paper provides an approximation of EMR (Approx-EMR) to make it scalable for large DNNs. This approximation avoids the need to loop over image categories when calculating effective weight matrices.\n    *   **Evaluation Mode for Batch Normalization:**  The paper uses evaluation mode in the forward propagation to compute EMR to avoid intertwining gradients when batch normalization is used.\n    *   **Performance:** EMR is shown to outperform basic adversarial training, TRADES, Input Gradient Regularization (IGR), and Hypersphere Embedding (HE). It also enhances the robustness of strong adversarial defense methods like MART and MAIL.\n    *   **Ablation Studies:** The paper includes ablation studies to analyze the impact of computing EMR using clean versus adversarial examples, and to evaluate the parameter sensitivity of EMR.\n\n2.  **Regularization Methods (Baselines):**\n\n    *   **Input Gradient Regularization (IGR) [41]:** IGR regularizes the norm of the loss gradient with respect to the input. The paper compares EMR against IGR and shows EMR achieves better robustness.\n    *   **Hypersphere Embedding (HE) [37]:** HE normalizes features and the classification layer to reduce the influence of weight norms. The paper benchmarks against HE and finds EMR to be superior, especially when considering stronger attacks like AutoAttack. Note: HE does not work well with TRADES adversarial training.\n    *   **Locally Linear Regularization (LLR) [38]:** The paper cites LLR as an approach to learn a more linear loss function, contrasting it with EMR's focus on controlling the local logit function's weight norm.\n\n3.  **Margin-Aware Instance Reweighting:**\n\n    *   **MAIL (Probabilistic Margin-Aware Instance Reweighting Learning) [26]:** MAIL re-weights samples based on a probabilistic margin. The paper shows that combining EMR with MAIL further improves adversarial robustness. It weights samples based on the probabilistic margin piy \u2212 maxj\u0338=y pij\n    *   **MMA (Max-Margin Adversarial Training) [13]:** Approximate the margin by pushing input samples to cross the classification boundary with PGD and recording the moved distance\n\n4.  **Other Defense Methods (Recent):**\n\n    *   **MART (Misclassification Aware adveRsarial Training) [48]:** EMR can be combined with MART to improve robustness.\n    *   **LBGAT [11]:** Learnable boundary guided adversarial training. The paper mentions that they are using the default settings in the official code.\n\n5.  **TRADES (Theoretically principled trade-off between robustness and accuracy) [53]:**\n    * Used in experiments as a baseline to compare EMR.\n\n6.  **Smooth Adversarial Training [49]:**\n    *  The paper cites Smooth Adversarial Training when stating that replacing the piecewise linear activation with a smooth activation function improves the performance of adversarial training.\n\n7.  **Improving robustness using generated data [16]:**\n    * The paper cites Improving robustness using generated data when stating that the training set can be augmented to enhance the robustness.\n\n8.  **Exploring architectural ingredients of adversarially robust deep neural networks [19]:**\n    * The paper cites Exploring architectural ingredients of adversarially robust deep neural networks when stating that some architectural configurations are better than others in terms of adversarial robustness.\n\n9.  **Learnable boundary guided adversarial training [11]:**\n    * The paper cites Learnable boundary guided adversarial training when stating AutoAttack has become a more important evaluation method than PGD for adversarial robustness in recent years\n\n**III. Models, Datasets, and Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Models:** The paper uses MLP, CNN, ResNet18, and WideResNet-34-10 architectures.\n*   **Datasets:** Experiments are conducted primarily on MNIST and CIFAR10.\n*   **Attacks:**  FGSM, PGD, and AutoAttack are employed for evaluating adversarial robustness.\n*   **Evaluation Metric:** PGD with l\u221e norm bound is used.\n*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  Grid search is used to find the best hyperparameters for EMR.\n*   **Model Selection:** Uses a validation set to avoid robust overfitting and select the model with the best robust test accuracy.\n\n**In summary:** The latest trends revolve around improving adversarial robustness through techniques that maximize effective margins, often building upon adversarial training. Regularization methods like EMR, which address the scale-variant property of common loss functions, show promise. Evaluation is shifting towards stronger attack methods like AutoAttack. Finally, the trend is towards methods that are scalable to large datasets and models."

Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on *understanding and exploiting* adversarial vulnerabilities in image classification models, rather than *defending* against them.  It analyzes adversarial examples in the frequency domain, proposing a novel black-box attack algorithm based on frequency decomposition. However, it discusses several trends and provides references to other papers that do focus on robustness.\n\n**Key Findings and Contributions Relevant to Adversarial Robustness Trends (Indirectly):**\n\n*   **Frequency Domain Analysis:** The paper's core argument is that adversarial perturbations are *not simply high-frequency or low-frequency.* Instead, they are significantly present in the *high-frequency components of low-frequency bands.* This suggests that models are vulnerable to subtle manipulations within specific frequency ranges. Understanding these vulnerabilities can inform the development of more robust models, but the paper itself doesn't directly propose a robustness technique.\n\n*   **Black-Box Attack Based on Frequency Decomposition:** The authors developed a black-box attack algorithm leveraging frequency decomposition. This algorithm combines low-frequency bands and high-frequency components of low-frequency bands, achieving a high attack success rate.  *While not a robustness technique itself, the success of this attack highlights a weakness in current models, which needs to be addressed by new defenses.*\n\n*   **Normalized Disturbance Visibility (NDV) Index:** The authors argue that L2 norm is insufficient for evaluating the imperceptibility of adversarial examples, especially those with discrete perturbations.

Transferability is a crucial concept in adversarial robustness because it allows attacks crafted on one model (a \"surrogate\" model) to successfully fool *other* models, including those with defense mechanisms.

Two specific types of feature mixing are explored:\n    *   **Low-Frequency Adversarial Features Mixing (LF-AFM):** Mixing clean low-frequency and high-frequency features with adversarial features extracted from the *low-frequency* part of the adversarial example.

This is presented as being more effective against normally-trained models.\n*   **Meta-Learning:**  The paper proposes a \"cross-frequency meta-optimization\" approach to resolve the conflict when using both LF-AFM and AFM. This involves:\n    *   **Meta-Train Step:**  Uses LF-AFM to boost attack transferability against defense models.\n    *   **Meta-Test Step:**  Uses AFM to stabilize gradients and enhance attack transferability against normally trained models.\n    *   **Final Update:** Updates the adversarial sample based on gradients from both meta-train and meta-test steps.\n\n**Specific Methods and Baselines Compared (Important for Context):**\n\nThe paper compares its method against several state-of-the-art attack methods, including:\n\n*   **Gradient-based methods:**\n    *   I-FGSM (Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method) [4]\n    *   MI-FGSM (Momentum Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method) [5]\n    *   NI-FGSM (Nesterov Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method) [6]\n    *   TI (Translation-Invariant) [7]\n    *   VT (Variance Tuning) [19]\n    *   GRA (Gradient Relevance Attack) [20]\n    *   SINI-FGSM [6]\n    *   VTMI-FGSM [19]\n    *    S[2]IMI-FGSM [16]\n\n*   **Input Augmentation-based methods:**\n    *   DI (Diverse Input) [8]\n    *   SI (Scale-Invariant) [6]\n    *   Admix [21]\n    *   AdvDrop [22]\n\n*   **Frequency-based attacks:**\n    *   Low-Frequency Adversarial Attack (LFAA) [23]\n\n*   **Defenses:**\n    *   Adversarial Training [12, 13]\n    *   JPEG compression [24]\n    *   Random Resizing and Padding (R&P) [25]\n    *   High-Level Representation Guided Denoiser (HGD) [26]\n    *   NeurIPS-r3 solution [27]\n    *   Neural Representation Purifier (NRP) [28]\n\n**Datasets and Models:**\n\n*   **Dataset:** ImageNet-Compatible dataset.\n*   **Source Models:** Inception-v3 (Inc-v3), Inception-v4 (Inc-v4), Inception-Resnet-v2 (IncRes-v2), and Resnet-v2-101 (Res-101).\n*   **Target Models:**  The source models plus adversarially trained models (Inc-v3adv, Inc-v3ens3, Inc-v3ens4, IncRes-v2ens) and transformer-based models ViT [30], LeViT [31], ConViT [32], Twins [33], and PiT [34].\n\n**Key Findings/Contributions:**\n\n*   Demonstrated that attacking low-frequency components can be more effective against defended models.\n*   Developed a feature mixing technique to combine clean and adversarial features in the frequency domain.\n*   Introduced a cross-frequency meta-optimization framework to improve the transferability of attacks against both normally trained and defense models.\n\n**Relevance to the Last 2 Years:**\n\nThe paper was published in 2023, so it is within the specified time frame.

      "summary": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided paper, focusing on trends in adversarial robustness for image classification (or, in this case, a related area of EEG signal classification) from the last 2 years.  Since the paper itself is dated roughly in the last 2 years (assuming a publication date in 2023 or 2024), all the information it contains qualifies.\n\n**I. Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   The paper addresses the vulnerability of deep learning models used for EEG-based brainprint recognition to adversarial attacks.  It highlights the lack of research in this specific area (brainprint recognition) and proposes a novel attack method.\n\n**II. Key Contributions Related to Adversarial Robustness Trends (within the context of EEG signal classification):**\n\n*   **Time-Frequency Joint Attacks:** The primary contribution is a new adversarial attack method called \"TFAttack\" (Time-Frequency Jointed Attack). This method is significant because it:\n    *   Jointly attacks both the time and frequency domains of EEG signals using wavelet transform.  This is different from existing methods that primarily focus on the time domain.\n    *   Aims to balance attack performance (success rate) with imperceptibility of the adversarial perturbations.  The frequency-domain attack component contributes to imperceptibility.\n    *   Alternates optimization between the time and frequency domains to improve attack efficiency.\n*   **Imperceptibility Metrics:** The paper emphasizes the importance of imperceptibility and uses not only L2 norm and cosine similarity but also the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) score as a metric.  DTW is used to evaluate the geometric similarity between waves, better reflecting the human visual system's (HVS) preferences.  This shows a trend towards more perceptually relevant metrics in evaluating adversarial attacks.\n*   **State-of-the-art Performance:** The paper claims state-of-the-art attack performance on three EEG datasets (SEED, MTED, EEGMMI) and against three deep learning models (EEGNet, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet) in both white-box and gray-box scenarios.  This suggests progress in the *effectiveness* of adversarial attacks.\n*   **Addressing Limitations of Existing Attacks:**  The paper explicitly addresses the limitations of existing time-domain attacks like FGSM and PGD, which generate perturbations resembling \"square waves\" that are visually perceptible.  It also notes that these attacks often ignore crucial frequency information in EEG signals.\n\n**III.  Details of the Proposed TFAttack Method:**\n\n*   **Wavelet Transform:** TFAttack uses wavelet transform to move between the time and frequency domains. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposes the EEG signal into low-frequency (xll) and high-frequency components (xlh, xhl, xhh). Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) reconstructs the signal.  The use of DWT and IDWT allows for gradient computation and backpropagation.\n*   **Optimization Procedure:** The attack iteratively updates perturbations in both the time and frequency domains. The optimization is performed using gradients from both domains.\n*   **Adversarial Loss Function:**  The paper uses a modified version of the Carlini & Wagner (C&W) loss function as the adversarial loss.\n*   **TAttack and FAttack components:** TFAttack is a composite of Time-domain Attacks (TAttack) and Frequency-domain Attacks (FAttack) to achieve a more imperceptible and powerful attack by capitalizing on gradients from the time-domain and frequency-domain data.\n\n**IV.  Experimental Results:**\n\n*   **White-box Attack:**  Experiments demonstrate that TFAttack achieves the highest Attack Success Rate (ASR) with the lowest L2 and DTW scores and the highest cosine similarity compared to FGSM, BIM, PGD, and C&W. This indicates that TFAttack is both more effective (higher ASR) and more imperceptible (lower L2, DTW, higher cosine similarity).\n*   **Perception Study:** A perception study shows that ASR increases with the strength of perturbations.  TFAttack consistently generates more powerful adversarial examples at the same perceptual distances or achieves the same ASR with lower L2, DTW, and higher cosine similarity, confirming its ability to create powerful and invisible attacks.\n*   **Transferability (Grey-box Attack):** Grey-box attack experiments on the EEGMMI dataset show that TFAttack has better transferability than FGSM and PGD. ShallowConvNet was found to be less robust.\n*   **Ablation Study:** Ablation experiments comparing TAttack, FAttack, and TFAttack show that TFAttack effectively combines the advantages of both time-domain and frequency-domain attacks, achieving the highest ASR with a relatively smaller perceptual distance.\n\n**V. Key Takeaways & Trends from the Paper**\n\n*   **Moving Beyond Time-Domain Attacks:** There's a trend toward considering frequency-domain information in adversarial attacks on EEG signals, which is shown to improve imperceptibility and potentially attack effectiveness.\n*   **Importance of Perceptual Metrics:** The use of DTW score, in addition to standard metrics like L2 norm and cosine similarity, suggests a growing awareness of the need to evaluate adversarial attacks based on human perception, especially for applications like BCIs where user experience and safety are critical.\n*   **Balancing Attack Strength and Imperceptibility:** The paper explicitly focuses on finding a balance between attack success rate and the visibility of adversarial perturbations. This is a crucial consideration for real-world deployment of adversarial defense mechanisms.\n\n**In summary,** this paper contributes to the recent trends in adversarial robustness by: 1) expanding the attack surface to include the frequency domain, 2) utilizing perceptual metrics for evaluation, and 3) emphasizing the importance of imperceptibility in adversarial attacks, specifically within the context of EEG-based systems. The development of the TFAttack method represents a step toward more sophisticated and potentially more dangerous adversarial attacks in the domain of brain-computer interfaces."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the provided paper, addressing the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"  I'll focus on aspects related to adversarial attacks and defenses, particularly those discussed in the paper and cited within.\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper**\n\nThe paper introduces a novel adversarial attack method called \"Low-Frequency Adversarial Attack (LFAA)\" designed to generate transferable, targeted adversarial examples for image classification. It focuses on manipulating the frequency components of images to craft attacks that can fool different models, even in black-box settings.  While the paper primarily *presents* a new attack, its literature review and experimental evaluation touch upon recent trends in adversarial robustness.\n\n**Key Trends and Techniques (Based on the Paper and Citations - last 2 years)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the recent trends discernible from the paper, organized for clarity:\n\n1.  **Transfer-based Attacks and Black-Box Settings:**\n    *   A major trend is the focus on *transfer-based attacks*, where adversarial examples crafted on one model are used to attack other, unknown models (black-box setting).  This is driven by the practical need to attack real-world systems where the attacker doesn't have full access to the target model.\n    *   The transferability of adversarial examples is a central challenge.\n    *   The paper explicitly positions itself within this trend, aiming to improve the transferability of *targeted* attacks (where the attacker wants the model to misclassify the image as a *specific* class).\n\n2.  **Generative Adversarial Attacks:**\n    *   Using generative models (like Generative Adversarial Networks, GANs) to create adversarial examples is a growing trend.  The paper cites several relevant works:\n        *   **C-GSP (Xiao Yang et al., ECCV 2022):** A conditional generator is trained to produce targeted adversarial perturbations. LFAA is inspired by C-GSP and uses a similar generator architecture but differs in how it manipulates frequency components.\n        *   **CDA (Muhammad Muzammal Naseer et al., 2019):** Uses relativistic training objectives to boost cross-domain transferability (though this citation is slightly outside the 2-year window, it's relevant to understanding the context).\n        *   **GAP (Omid Poursaeed et al., CVPR 2018):** Learns a generator to produce image-agnostic perturbations for targeted attacks.\n    *   Generative approaches are seen as more efficient because they can learn adversarial patterns from a large dataset, rather than overfitting to a single image or model.\n    *   The paper argues that generative models can produce more generalizable attacks compared to gradient-based methods.\n\n3.  **Frequency-Based Attacks:**\n    *   Analyzing and exploiting the frequency characteristics of images is an emerging trend in adversarial attacks.  The paper emphasizes that DNNs are vulnerable to perturbations in both high-frequency and low-frequency components.\n    *   Relevant papers cited:\n        *   **Yuyang Long et al., ECCV 2022:** Uses frequency domain model augmentation for adversarial attack, by perturbing input images with Gaussian noise in the frequency domain as a data augmentation technique\n        *   **Qilong Zhang et al., arXiv 2022:** Proposes a method of crafting adversarial examples by replacing the high-frequency portion of an image with a handcrafted adversarial patch.\n    *   The *LFAA* method directly contributes to this trend by manipulating the low-frequency components of images to embed target class information.\n    *   The motivation is that high-frequency components capture texture and noise, while low-frequency components represent the object's shape. Modifying the shape (low-frequency) can be crucial for targeted attacks.\n\n4.  **Adversarial Defense Methods and Robustness:**\n    *   The paper evaluates LFAA against several defense mechanisms, indicating an ongoing effort to develop more robust models.  These defenses represent key trends:\n        *   **Adversarial Training:** Training models with adversarial examples to improve robustness (cited: Madry et al., ICLR 2018). Ensemble adversarial training (Tram\u00e8r et al., ICLR 2018) is a variation.\n        *   **Denoising Filters:** Removing adversarial perturbations before feeding the image to the classifier. Examples include HGD (Liao et al., CVPR 2018) and NRP (Naseer et al., CVPR 2020).\n        *   **Input Transformations:** Modifying the input image to mitigate the effect of perturbations. Examples include Random Resizing and Padding (R&P) (Xie et al., ICLR 2018), Feature Distillation (FD) (Liu et al., CVPR 2019).\n\n5.  **Targeted Attacks and Loss Functions:**\n    *   The paper highlights that achieving high transferability in *targeted* attacks is more challenging than in untargeted attacks.\n    *   Advanced loss functions are being explored for targeted attacks:\n        *   **Po-Trip (Maosen Li et al., CVPR 2020):** Adopts Poincare distance and Triplet loss to replace cross-entropy, which has a vanishing gradient in iterative targeted attacks.\n        *   **Logits attack (Zhengyu Zhao et al., NeurIPS 2021):** Uses the logits output of the target class as the loss function and performs a large number of iterations.\n\n**Specific Techniques Mentioned (relevant to research question):**\n\n*   **MI-FGSM (Yinpeng Dong et al., CVPR 2018):** Adds momentum to I-FGSM to stabilize the optimization process.\n*   **DIM (Cihang Xie et al., CVPR 2019):** Diverse Input Method, rescales the input image to random sizes and adds padding to a fixed size before calculating the gradient.\n*   **TIM (Yinpeng Dong et al., CVPR 2019):** Translation Invariant Attack, approximates the gradient calculation for a set of translated images by convolving the gradient with a Gaussian kernel.\n*   **Admix (Xiaosen Wang et al., ICCV 2021):** Mixes the input image with a small portion of images from other categories.\n\n**Summary of Trends**\n\nIn summary, the recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, as evidenced by this paper and its citations, include:\n\n*   A shift towards black-box and transfer-based attacks to address real-world scenarios.\n*   Increased use of generative models for crafting adversarial examples that generalize better.\n*   Exploration of frequency-based attacks to exploit vulnerabilities related to image texture and shape.\n*   Development of various defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, denoising, and input transformations.\n*   Focus on improving the transferability and effectiveness of *targeted* adversarial attacks, often requiring specialized loss functions.\n\nThe LFAA method presented in the paper contributes to the trends of frequency-based attacks and generative adversarial attacks, aiming to improve the transferability of targeted attacks against image classification models."

      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, specifically focusing on papers from the last 2 years (2022-2024, given the paper's publication in 2024). Note that the paper itself focuses on Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC), not image classification directly. However, it references and adapts concepts from adversarial robustness research in image classification and deep learning.\n\n**Key Findings and Trends (as applied to AMC, drawing parallels to Image Classification):**\n\n1.  **Frequency Domain Attacks:** A major trend is the shift from traditional time-domain adversarial attacks to frequency-domain attacks.\n    *   **Problem:** Existing time-domain attacks (like FGSM, PGD, UAP when naively applied) introduce high-frequency components due to abrupt changes in the time domain. This makes the adversarial examples easily detectable.\n    *   **Solution:**  The paper proposes \"Spectrum Focused Frequency Adversarial Attacks (SFFAA)\" and \"Meta-SFFAA,\" which operate in the frequency domain. This aligns with a trend in adversarial robustness to consider the *spectral* characteristics of adversarial perturbations. By manipulating the frequency spectrum directly, the attack can concentrate adversarial energy in specific frequency bands, making the attack more stealthy and potentially more effective.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:** This trend of frequency domain analysis is relevant to image classification, as images can also be represented in the frequency domain (e.g., using Discrete Cosine Transform - DCT). Research in image classification also explores frequency-based attacks and defenses.\n\n2.  **Meta-Learning for Transferability:** Another trend highlighted is the use of meta-learning to improve the *transferability* of adversarial attacks.\n    *   **Problem:**  Adversarial examples generated using white-box attacks (where the attacker knows the model architecture and parameters) often do not transfer well to black-box scenarios (where the attacker has limited or no knowledge of the target model).\n    *   **Solution:** The paper's \"Meta-SFFAA\" algorithm uses a meta-learning approach. It trains the attack on a collection of different models (meta-train) and then tests its transferability on a separate model (meta-test). This process aims to learn adversarial perturbations that generalize better across different model architectures and training procedures, significantly boosting black-box attack success.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:** Meta-learning for adversarial transferability is a very active area of research in image classification. Researchers are exploring various meta-learning techniques to create more robust and transferable adversarial examples.\n\n3.  **Concealment as a Key Goal:**  A critical trend is focusing on the *concealment* of adversarial examples.\n    *   **Problem:** Highly detectable adversarial examples are less practical.  If an adversarial attack is easily identified, it can be mitigated.\n    *   **Solution:**  The paper explicitly addresses concealment by focusing adversarial energy on the spectrum where the signal is located, thereby maintaining spectral concealment. They also use the fitting difference (FD) metric to evaluate the signal time domain quality and perturbation out-spectrum energy ratio (OSER) to measure frequency domain concealment.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:** The emphasis on stealthiness is mirrored in image classification, with research focusing on creating adversarial examples that are less perceptible to humans and difficult to detect by defense mechanisms.\n\n4.  **Evaluation Metrics Beyond Accuracy:**  The paper emphasizes the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond just classification accuracy to assess the quality of adversarial attacks.\n    *   **Problem:**  Simply measuring the drop in accuracy doesn't capture the stealthiness or the time domain quality of the attack.\n    *   **Solution:** They introduce and use \"Out-Spectrum Energy Ratio (OSER)\" to measure frequency domain concealment and \"Fitting Difference (FD)\" to evaluate the signal time domain quality.\n    *   **Relevance to Image Classification:** Image classification research follows a similar trend, employing metrics like perceptual distance (e.g., LPIPS) and structural similarity (SSIM) in addition to accuracy to better evaluate the effectiveness and imperceptibility of adversarial attacks.\n\n**Specific Papers Referenced (from the last 2 years - relevant to this research question):**\n\nThe following papers cited are within the relevant timeframe (2022-2024, but considering the paper was written likely in late 2023, or early 2024, anything from 2021 onwards would likely be considered \"recent):\n\n*   **[11] B.

While technically slightly outside the strict 2-year window, it's foundational to the paper's approach.\n\n**Limitations of the Paper in Answering the Research Question:**\n\n*   **AMC Focus:** The paper's primary focus is on adversarial attacks against *Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC)*, not image classification. While the concepts and techniques are related, the specific challenges and solutions may differ. Therefore, the direct applicability of the paper to the research question is somewhat limited.\n*   **Limited Literature Review:** The paper provides a relatively brief overview of the existing literature. A more comprehensive survey would be needed to fully understand all the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification.\n\nIn summary, while the provided paper isn't directly about image classification, it highlights the importance of frequency domain analysis, meta-learning for transferability, and concealment as important trends in adversarial robustness research that are directly relevant to image classification. It also points to a couple of more recent papers that investigate similar topics."

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this research paper to extract the information relevant to the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on the last 2 years.\n\n**Paper Focus & Relevance:**\n\n*   The paper focuses on adversarial attacks against *face forgery detection* systems, *not* general image classification. While the techniques used might have some overlap, the specific context is important.\n*   The paper *was* published within the last 2 years (2023), so it satisfies the time constraint.\n\n**Key Findings & Techniques (Relevant to Adversarial Robustness in General):**\n\n*   **Frequency Domain Attacks:** This is a core idea of the paper and is potentially applicable beyond face forgery.\n    *   The authors propose attacking in the frequency domain (using Discrete Cosine Transform - DCT) instead of directly manipulating pixels in the spatial domain.\n    *   **Rationale:** Frequency domain attacks can be more imperceptible to humans and avoid adding redundant noise compared to spatial attacks (like FGSM, PGD). They aim to exploit frequency differences that exist between real and fake images, making attacks more transferable.\n    *   They use a \"fusion module\" to modify energy in different frequency bands based on an adversarial loss.\n    *   **Significance:** This suggests a trend towards exploring non-pixel-space attacks to improve stealth and transferability. This is important because defenses are becoming better at detecting pixel-level perturbations.\n\n*   **Hybrid Adversarial Attacks (Meta-Learning Inspired):** This is another crucial aspect.\n    *   The authors propose a \"hybrid\" attack that combines spatial and frequency domain attacks.\n    *   **Inspiration:** Inspired by Meta-Learning, they iteratively update perturbations using gradients from both spatial and frequency domains. The attacks are alternated between both domains.\n    *   **Rationale:**  This allows the attack to leverage the strengths of both domains.  Spatial attacks might be good at directly influencing the classifier, while frequency attacks contribute to stealth and transferability.  Combining them creates a stronger overall attack.\n    *   **Significance:** This aligns with a trend towards more sophisticated attack strategies that combine multiple techniques or exploit different representations of the data.\n\n*   **Transferability Focus:** The paper emphasizes improving the transferability of attacks, which is a major concern in adversarial robustness.\n    *   They explicitly try to create attacks that can fool different face forgery detectors (both spatial-based and frequency-based), even without knowing the specific architecture or parameters (black-box attack).\n    *   The frequency-based component is motivated by the idea that frequency characteristics are a common vulnerability across different detectors.\n    *   Ensemble attacks, where adversarial examples are generated using an ensemble of multiple networks, achieve stronger attack performance and transferability.\n    *   **Significance:** Transferability is crucial because, in real-world scenarios, attackers often don't have full access to the target model.\n\n*   **Evaluation on State-of-the-Art Detectors:** The paper tests its attacks against recent face forgery detection methods, which is important for assessing their effectiveness.\n    *   They test against both spatial-based (EfficientNet b4, ResNet 50, XceptionNet) and frequency-based (F3-Net, LRL) detectors.\n\n*   **Perceptibility:** The paper considers the imperceptibility of the attacks to human observers.\n    *   They argue that frequency-based attacks are less visually noticeable than spatial attacks.\n    *   They use metrics like MSE, PSNR, and SSIM to quantitatively evaluate image quality (to measure the difference between adversarial and original images).\n\n**Limitations & Caveats:**\n\n*   **Face Forgery Specific:**  Remember that the primary focus is face forgery. Some of the frequency-domain characteristics exploited might be unique to this task and not directly transferable to general image classification.\n*   **Limited Defense Analysis:** The paper primarily focuses on *attacking* systems, not on *defending* against attacks. It doesn't deeply explore existing defenses or propose new defense mechanisms.\n\n**Relevant Sections and Details:**\n\n*   **Abstract:** Summarizes the frequency adversarial attack and hybrid adversarial attack.\n*   **Introduction:** Highlights the vulnerability of existing face forgery detectors to adversarial examples and the importance of frequency diversity as a clue for detection.\n*   **Related Work:** Briefly reviews face forgery generation and detection methods, as well as adversarial attack techniques.\n*   **Method:** Describes the proposed frequency adversarial attack, including the use of DCT, fusion module, and hybrid adversarial attack.\n*   **Experiment:** Presents experimental setup, evaluation metrics, and results of the proposed attack method on spatial-based and frequency-based models.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis paper suggests the following trends in adversarial robustness, specifically applicable to face forgery detection, but with potential implications for image classification more broadly:\n\n1.  **Shift to Frequency Domain:** Moving beyond pixel-space attacks to frequency domain manipulation for improved stealth and transferability.\n2.  **Hybrid Attack Strategies:** Combining multiple attack techniques (e.g., spatial and frequency) to leverage the strengths of each.\n3.  **Emphasis on Transferability:** Designing attacks that can generalize to different target models (black-box settings).\n4.  **Perceptibility Matters:**  Considering the human-detectability of adversarial examples alongside their effectiveness at fooling machines."

General Overview of the Paper**\n\n*   **Focus:** The paper presents a *theoretical* analysis of adversarial training, aiming to understand *why* adversarial examples exist and *how* adversarial training improves robustness. It's *not* primarily about proposing new adversarial defense methods or empirically evaluating existing ones, but the findings are substantiated with experiments.\n*   **Approach:** The authors use a simplified, structured data model based on a decomposition of \"robust\" and \"non-robust\" features. They then analyze the feature learning process of neural networks under standard training vs. adversarial training.\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   Standard training leads neural networks to primarily learn \"non-robust\" features, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations.\n    *   Adversarial training can provably enhance the learning of \"robust\" features and suppress the learning of \"non-robust\" ones.\n*   **Relevance to the Research Question:** While not directly presenting *new* trends in defenses, it offers insights into *why* certain defenses (specifically adversarial training) work, which can indirectly inform the development of future defense strategies. The experiments are on image classification tasks, which is the area of interest.\n\n**II. Extraction of Relevant Information**\n\nBecause the main thrust of the paper is theoretical, the most relevant information for answering your research question lies in how the *theoretical understanding* relates to current empirical trends.\n\n*   **Adversarial Training as a Foundation:** The paper implicitly acknowledges that adversarial training is a *dominant* trend in adversarial robustness. They frame their theoretical analysis around *explaining* its empirical success (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Madry et al., 2018; Shafahi et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Pang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023 are cited as seminal works related to adversarial training).\n*   **Data Assumptions and the Theory-Practice Gap:** The paper highlights a key challenge: the gap between theoretical understandings and practical observations in adversarial robustness. This is attributed to the *unrealistic data assumptions* made in many theoretical frameworks. The authors motivate their work by aiming to bridge this gap by considering a more realistic data model based on robust/non-robust feature decomposition, a concept that aligns with empirical findings from Ilyas et al. (2019) and others.\n\n*   **Robust and Non-Robust Features:**  The central concept of robust/non-robust feature decomposition relates to a line of empirical research:\n    *   Ilyas et al. (2019) demonstrated empirically that adversarial examples are not bugs, but are features. The current paper builds on this by providing a theoretical justification.\n    *   The paper suggests that networks leveraging robust features act as robust classifiers, while those relying on non-robust features perform well on clean data but not on perturbed data.\n*   **Feature Learning Theory:** The paper connects adversarial robustness to the broader field of feature learning theory in deep learning. It cites recent studies (Wen & Li, 2021; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Jelassi et al., 2022; Chidambaram et al., 2023; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2023b;a; Lu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024) that aim to explore how features are learned in deep learning tasks. The paper aims to study how feature learning differs when applying adversarial training.\n*   **Limitations and Future Work:** The authors acknowledge limitations and suggest future research directions.\n    *   Extending the theoretical analysis to *deeper neural networks.*\n    *   Extending the theoretical analysis to *adversarial training based on multi-step gradient ascent algorithms, such as PGD.*\n\n**III.

It assesses robustness against various image corruptions and different training objectives, including adversarial robustness. The study identifies gaps between NN and human robustness. It is also in the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, I've analyzed the provided research paper and extracted the information most relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper (and Relevance to Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   The paper primarily focuses on **corruption robustness**, which is related to, but distinct from, adversarial robustness. Corruption robustness measures the average-case performance of a model on images with common corruptions (e.g., noise, blur), while adversarial robustness focuses on worst-case performance against small, carefully crafted perturbations designed to fool the model. The paper argues that real-world changes are often of a bigger range than those considered in adversarial robustness.\n*   The paper introduces **Visually-Continuous Corruption Robustness (VCR)**, which assesses robustness over a continuous range of corruption levels, unlike traditional benchmarks that use a fixed set of parameter values.\n\n**II. Relevant Sections and Findings:**\n\n*   **Introduction:**\n    *   Highlights the importance of robustness against real-world corruptions for safety-critical applications.\n    *   Points out the limitations of existing benchmarks that use pre-selected parameter values for corruptions, potentially leading to biased evaluation.\n*   **Related Work:**\n    *   Explicitly distinguishes the paper's focus from **Adversarial Robustness**: \"Adversarial robustness measures the worst-case performance on images with added 'small' distortions or perturbations tailored to confuse a classifier [15]. However, changes that can be encountered in the real-world situations are often of a much bigger range [22]. Thus, in this paper, we focus on average-case performance over a realistic range of changes.\" This statement clearly sets the paper's scope.\n*   **Visually-Continuous Corruption Robustness (VCR):**\n    *   Defines VCR in terms of the visual impact of image corruption on human perception, quantified using the Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) metric.\n    *   Defines robustness properties in terms of accuracy (correct prediction) and prediction consistency (consistent predictions before and after corruption).\n*   **Experiments:**\n    *   **Experiment 1:** Compares robustness measured with IMAGENET-C (a standard corruption benchmark) and VCR. It finds that IMAGENET-C has limited coverage of the full range of corruption levels, leading to potentially biased evaluation.\n    *   **Experiment 2:** Compares VCR of DNNs with human performance using novel human-aware metrics (HMRI and MRSI).  Findings show that NNs still lag behind humans in robustness, especially for blur corruptions. Vision transformers show the most promise for reaching human-level robustness.\n    *   **Experiment 3:** Shows that data augmentation using VCR-generated images can improve model robustness relative to humans.\n    *   **Experiment 4:** Investigates visually similar corruption functions (e.g., different types of noise) and finds that humans perceive them similarly, while NNs may react differently.\n\n**III. Specific Trends and Models Mentioned (Relevant to Robustness in General):**\n\n*   **Vision Transformers (ViTs):** The paper consistently highlights ViTs as showing the best performance in corruption robustness compared to other architectures like CNNs (ResNet, AlexNet) (See Figs 6 and 7 and discussion in the text).  Specifically, models like `DINOV2_GIANT`, `TIAN_DEIT-B`, and `TIAN_DEIT-S` perform well.\n*   **Adversarial Training:** The paper includes adversarially trained models (e.g., `DO_50_2_LINF`, `LIU_SWIN-L`, `LIU_CONVNEXT-L`, `SINGH_CONVNEXT-L-CONVSTEM`) in its evaluation, although the focus is on average-case corruption robustness rather than worst-case adversarial robustness.\n*   **Data Augmentation:** Using corrupted images for data augmentation is noted as a method for improving robustness (related work). The paper's experiments show that fine-tuning models on VCR-generated images can improve their robustness.\n*   **CLIP:** The paper includes a CLIP model (`CLIP`), highlighting the use of vision-language pretraining for robustness.\n*   **Semi-Weakly Supervised Learning (SWSL):** SWSL models (`SWSL_RESNET18`, `SWSL_RESNEXT101_32X16D`) are included in the study.\n*   **Training Methods:** The paper makes general mentions of training methods, e.g., supervised, self-supervised, semi-weakly supervised, and adversarial training.\n\n**IV. Key Takeaways for Adversarial Robustness (Inferred):**\n\n*   While not the direct focus, the paper suggests that **improving average-case robustness (corruption robustness) may be a necessary step toward improving worst-case robustness (adversarial robustness).** A model that is generally robust to common corruptions may be more resilient to adversarial perturbations.\n*   **Vision Transformers** are a promising architecture for robust image classification, performing well against corruptions. This suggests they may also be more robust against adversarial attacks.\n*   **Data augmentation with diverse corruptions** (as emphasized by VCR) is crucial for improving model robustness.  This likely extends to adversarial training, where augmenting with a wider range of adversarial examples could lead to more robust models.\n\n**V. Limitations:**\n\n*   **Focus on Average-Case Performance:**  The paper's explicit focus is on average-case performance against common corruptions, not worst-case adversarial attacks.\n*   **Image Quality Assessment Metric:**  VCR relies on the VIF metric, which is limited to pixel-level corruptions. The paper acknowledges that further research is needed for metrics suitable for other types of corruption (e.g., geometric).\n\n**In summary:**  This paper doesn't directly address adversarial robustness, but it provides valuable insights into related areas of corruption robustness. The key trends relevant to adversarial robustness are the promise of Vision Transformers, the importance of diverse data augmentation, and the potential link between average-case and worst-case robustness. The paper argues for more comprehensive testing of robustness using a continuous range of corruption levels, which could inform future research in adversarial robustness as well. The publication date (ICSE\u20192022 and after) falls within the last 2 years, satisfying the temporal constraint."

While it's about explainability, it directly mentions robustness and model training modifications to enhance it, making it relevant to adversarial robustness trends. It's also within the specified time frame.",
      "summary": "Okay, let's extract the relevant information from this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Paper Title:** Enhancing Post-Hoc Explanation Benchmark Reliability for Image Classification\n\n**Publication Date:** July 2023\n\n**Focus:**  The paper primarily focuses on improving the *reliability* of benchmarking post-hoc explanation methods for image classification models, *not directly on improving adversarial robustness* of image classification models themselves. However, the *methods employed to improve benchmark reliability involve techniques related to model robustness, including adversarial training*.\n\n**Key Ideas and Techniques (Related to Robustness, even indirectly):**\n\n*   **Addressing OOD Samples:** The paper argues that a key reason for the unreliability of faithfulness metrics in evaluating explanation methods is that the *perturbed samples generated during the evaluation process fall outside the training distribution (OOD)*. This leads to unpredictable model behavior.\n\n*   **Model Training Modifications for \"Robustness\":** To combat OOD issues and improve benchmark reliability, the authors propose modifications to the *training* of the image classification models *used for benchmarking* explanation methods. These modifications indirectly relate to making the model more robust to perturbations:\n\n    *   **Feeding Perturbed Samples During Training (Faithfulness Perturbations - FP):** This involves creating training batches of images that have been perturbed in ways that mimic the kinds of perturbations used by faithfulness metrics (e.g., masking salient regions, blurring). The goal is to make the model more familiar with these types of out-of-distribution inputs. The authors explore four types of perturbations: AD-inspired, ADD-inspired, DAUC-inspired, and IAUC-inspired.\n    *   **Adversarial Perturbations (AP):**  Using adversarial training (Projected Gradient Descent - PGD), the authors add small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input images to *smooth the model's input space*.  This aims to make the model's predictions less sensitive to small changes in the input, *which indirectly increases robustness to adversarial examples* and, more importantly for the paper's main goal, leads to smoother, less noisy score curves when masking the whole image to compute faithfulness metrics.\n    *   **Combining Perturbations (FP + AP):** The study also investigates the effects of training with both faithfulness and adversarial perturbations.\n    *   **Focal Loss (FL):**  Replacing the standard cross-entropy (CE) loss with focal loss (FL) is employed to improve model calibration. The FL encourages the model to provide more consistent confidence levels, ensuring that decreasing accuracy (by masking parts of an image) corresponds to a drop in confidence.\n\n*   **Evaluation Metric (Indirectly Related):** The authors use Krippendorf's alpha to quantify the reliability of the explanation benchmark. Higher alpha values indicate more consistent rankings of explanation methods across different images.  The *goal is NOT to improve alpha directly, but to use it to evaluate the effect of the robustness-related training modifications*.\n\n**Experimental Setup:**\n\n*   **Datasets:** CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, FGVC Aircraft, CROHNIPI, and Time-lapse embryo.\n*   **Architecture:** ResNet-50\n*   **Post-hoc methods used:** CAM, Grad-CAM (GC), Grad-CAM++ (GC++), Score-CAM (SC), Guided Backpropagation (GP), Integrated Gradients (IG), SmoothGrad (SG), varGrad (VG), Feature Permutation (FeatPerm), Feature Ablation (FeatAbl), Occlusion and RISE.\n*   **Faithfulness Metrics:** Average Drop (AD), Average Drop in Deletion (ADD), DAUC, IAUC, DC, IC, DC non-cumulative (DCNC) and IC non-cumulative (IC-NC)\n*   **Baselines:**  Models trained with standard cross-entropy loss on unmodified images.\n\n**Key Findings (Relevant to Robustness/Generalization):**\n\n*   Training with FP helps to yield models with superior accuracy on FP images compared to settings without FP.\n*   The training modifications, especially the combination of FP and FL, significantly improved the reliability of the post-hoc explanation benchmarks (as measured by Krippendorf's alpha).\n*   Using the training modifications proposed, the explanations rankings are more similar with each other, which means that one can reduce the number of images N on which explanations are computed, while maintaining the same top-1 method, for example.\n*   The best-calibrated models are obtained following training using the FL.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n*   The approach increases computational cost.\n*   Future work could focus on understanding how modifications interact, how AP are redundant with FP, and improving benchmark reliability as measured by the correlation between fidelity scores.\n\n**Relevance to the Research Question:**\n\nWhile the paper does *not* directly address adversarial robustness for image classification in the traditional sense (e.g., improving accuracy against adversarial attacks), it does explore techniques that *indirectly* enhance model robustness (adversarial training, input diversification via perturbed samples) as a means to improve the reliability of explanation method benchmarks. The paper doesn't focus on defending against adversarial attacks directly, but it shows that models trained with adversarial and other perturbations exhibit more stable behavior when evaluated with explanation faithfulness metrics. This is because these metrics depend on model behavior under different kinds of input manipulations. The training strategies can be considered as related to adversarial robustness, as they try to smooth the model's response to input variations.\n\n**In summary, this paper indicates a trend in using adversarial training and other robustness-enhancing techniques as a way to improve the reliability of explainability methods, rather than focusing on improving image classification performance directly.**"

It introduces a new benchmark dataset (PatchCamelyon-C and LocalTCT-C) generated by applying various corruptions to pathology images. The paper evaluates the performance of different DNN architectures (CNNs and Vision Transformers) on this benchmark.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness for Image Classification (Last 2 Years):**\n\nWhile the paper doesn't explicitly delve into *adversarial attacks* (which is a specific type of robustness), it is highly relevant because:\n\n*   **Corruption Robustness is Related:**  Robustness to common corruptions is a *form* of robustness.  Models that are robust to corruptions *may* also be more resistant to certain adversarial attacks, and vice versa. The underlying principles and techniques used to improve robustness are often transferable.\n*   **Benchmarking is Crucial:** The paper's main contribution is a new benchmark. Benchmarks are essential for tracking progress in the field of robustness (including adversarial robustness).  By providing a standardized way to evaluate models, it enables researchers to compare different defense mechanisms.\n*   **Focus on Real-World Pathology Images:**  The paper addresses a critical need for robustness in a high-stakes application (medical diagnosis). This highlights the practical importance of developing robust models, whether against adversarial attacks or common corruptions.\n*   **Evaluation of Modern Architectures:** The paper evaluates both CNNs and Vision Transformers, which are the dominant architectures in image classification.

This allows for a more nuanced evaluation of robustness.\n\n2.  **Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   **Corruption Error (CE):** The average error across all corruption types and severity levels.\n    *   **Relative Corruption Error (rCE):** The ratio of CE to the error on the clean validation set.  This measures the *degradation* in performance due to corruptions.\n    *   **Corruption Error of Confidence (CEC):**  A new metric designed to evaluate the stability of the model's confidence estimates under corruption.  It measures the degree to which confidence decreases as the severity of the corruption increases.\n\n3.  **DNN Architectures Evaluated:**\n    *   **CNNs:** AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNet, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB7.\n    *   **Vision Transformers:** ViT (Vision Transformer), Swin Transformer, DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer).\n\n4.  **Key Findings:**\n    *   **Significant Accuracy Drop:** DNNs suffer a significant accuracy decrease on corrupted images (error rate approximately doubled compared to clean images).\n    *   **Unreliable Confidence:** Models exhibit unreliable confidence estimations under corruption (high CEC values). The confidence of vision transformers is less reliable than CNNs.\n    *   **Correlation with Generalization:** The benchmark is more correlated with the test error than the clean validation set, suggesting it is a better indicator of generalization ability.\n    *   **Impact of Corruption Type:** Different architectures are more or less vulnerable to specific types of corruptions.  Some corruptions have a greater impact on performance than others.\n    *    **Vision Transformers show better robustness towards image corruptions (smaller rCE values)\n\n5.  **Future Work (Important):**\n    *   **Input Augmentation:**  The paper acknowledges that input augmentation (a very common technique) can improve robustness and that they will analyze its impact on corruption robustness in future work.\n    *   **Strong Augmentations** Big architectures improve robustness with this technique.\n\n**Why this paper is relevant given the recency constraint, even though it doesn't focus on adversarial attacks directly:**\n\n1.  **It was published very recently (2023), making it within the last 2 years.**\n2.  **The techniques used to create the benchmark, evaluate models, and improve robustness are relevant to adversarial robustness.** For example, input augmentation is a common defense against adversarial attacks.\n3.  **The findings about the robustness of different architectures (CNNs vs. Vision Transformers) are informative.** This is useful for researchers who are working on adversarial robustness, as they can use this information to guide their research.\n4.  **It highlights the importance of robustness in a real-world application.** This is a reminder that adversarial robustness is not just an academic problem but a practical one.\n\nIn summary, while this paper does not directly address the *latest trends in adversarial robustness*, it provides valuable insights into the robustness of image classification models against common corruptions, which is a related and important area of research.

Under the same perturbation constraint, these classifiers present lower confidence scores and higher loss increases for AI-generated images.\"*\n\n    *   Under the same perturbation constraints, classifiers exhibit lower confidence scores and higher loss increases for AI-generated images, making them easier to fool.\n\n*   **Robust Accuracy (RA) as Metric:** The paper employs *Robust Accuracy (RA)* to quantify the robustness of the classifiers. RA is defined as the percentage of perturbed images correctly predicted by the classifiers.\n\n*   **Details of the Robustness Evaluation Methodology:**\n\n    *   **Perturbations:** Both random noise (Gaussian noise) and adversarial noise are used to perturb the images.\n    *   **Adversarial Attack Algorithms:** FGSM, PGD, and DeepFool are employed.\n    *   **Targeted vs. Untargeted Attacks (VLMs):** For VLMs, untargeted attacks are transformed into targeted attacks to ensure the adversarial examples lead to opposite predictions. Instead of maximizing the loss between the classifier\u2019s prediction and the original label (y), the paper focuses on minimizing the loss of a VLM between its prediction and the defined target output (ytar), as shown in Equation 2.\n        *   *xadv := argmin L(\u03b8, x + \u2206x, ytar), \u2206x (2)\n        \u2225\u2206x\u2225p < \u03b5.*\n\n    *   **Perturbation Budget:** The L\u221e norm is used, with \u03b5 set to 0.01, and the number of optimization iterations is limited to 100.\n\n*   **Findings in Robustness Evaluation:** The result from the experiment showed the Robust Accuracy (RA) of seven open-source classifiers for four types of perturbations, VLM-based classifiers showed the highest robustness, and most classifiers exhibited lower RAs on AI-generated images compared to their real-world counterparts.\n\n*   **PerspectiveVision's Improved Robustness:** PerspectiveVision, the LoRA fine-tuned LLaVA model, shows *significantly improved robustness* compared to the zero-shot LLaVA model.\n    *   The paper notes: *\"While zero-shot LLaVA shows an average RA of 0.666-0.725 (see Table 5) under four perturbations, fine-tuned LLaVA increases the average RA to 0.952 on UnsafeBench test set and 0.912 on OOD AI-generated images, in Table 7.\"*\n\n*   **Loss Analysis:** Classifiers tend to be more sensitive to perturbations in AI-generated images, leading to a higher loss increase, even with the same amount of perturbation.\n\n**Latest Trends and Insights based on this Paper (within the last 2 years):**\n\n1.  **Focus Shift:**  The trend is shifting towards evaluating adversarial robustness *specifically in the context of image safety*.  This is driven by concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated content and the need for reliable safety filters.\n2.  **VLMs Emerge as More Robust:** VLMs show promise for adversarial robustness compared to traditional classifiers in image safety. However, they are still vulnerable and require further research.  The dependence of VLM performance on prompt engineering is also a factor.\n3.  **AI-Generated Content as a Challenge:** AI-generated images pose a significant challenge to adversarial robustness. The distribution shift between real-world and AI-generated images makes existing classifiers *more susceptible* to adversarial attacks. This necessitates new techniques to improve robustness against AI-generated adversarial examples.\n4.  **Importance of Pre-trained Models:** Leveraging large pre-trained models (CLIP, LLaMA) improves robustness compared to training smaller classifiers from scratch.\n5.  **Fine-tuning and LoRA:** Fine-tuning VLMs, especially with techniques like LoRA, can significantly improve both effectiveness and robustness in image safety classification.\n6.  **Robustness Metrics:** The trend uses the Robust Accuracy (RA) metric as the main measure, and also relies on measuring Confidence Score and Cross-entropy Loss for further analysis.\n7.  **Data Augmentation** Improving generalizability through data augmentation.\n\nIn summary, this paper highlights the growing importance of adversarial robustness for image safety classifiers, especially in the face of AI-generated content. It points to VLMs as a promising direction, while also emphasizing the need to address the challenges posed by distribution shifts and the vulnerability of traditional classifiers. The UnsafeBench framework and the PerspectiveVision model contribute valuable resources and insights to this evolving area of research."

      "relevancy": "This paper introduces a new robustness measurement for image classification models compared with a surrogate oracle (i.e., a foundation model). It is also within the last 2 years.",
      "summary": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided paper and extracted the information relevant to your research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant content:\n\n**I. Core Focus of the Paper (and Relevance to Adversarial Robustness):**\n\n*   The paper introduces a *new robustness measurement* for image classification models, comparing their performance against \"surrogate oracles\" (zoo of foundation models). This is inherently tied to adversarial robustness, as it explores how models behave under perturbations designed to expose weaknesses.\n*   It proposes a *new evaluation protocol* to generate \"adversarial\" datasets dynamically, perturbing samples to be different from existing test samples, while preserving the image-label structure (ensured by the foundation models).  This is a core trend in adversarial robustness - moving away from fixed datasets and towards adaptive attacks.\n\n**II. Key Trends and Concepts Related to Adversarial Robustness (within the Last 2 Years):**\n\n*   **Dynamic Evaluation Protocols:** The paper argues against relying on fixed benchmark datasets for evaluating robustness. It highlights that models can overfit to these datasets, leading to misleading results. The proposed approach is a \"dynamic process of generating evaluation datasets\" to mitigate this issue. This reflects a trend in the field to move towards more adaptive and challenging evaluation methods.\n*   **Foundation Model-Oriented Robustness (FMR):**  The paper introduces FMR, a metric that measures robustness relative to foundation models. The core idea is that a robust model should behave similarly to a well-performing foundation model. This emphasizes a move towards *human-aligned* or *oracle-aligned* robustness, where robustness is defined by agreement with a reliable, high-performing model or human perception.\n*   **Counterfactual Generation:** The method uses \"counterfactual generation\" with surrogate oracles (foundation models). This means generating perturbed images that *should* still belong to the same class, according to the oracle, but *fool* the model being evaluated.  This connects to the trend of using generative models for creating adversarial examples and probing model vulnerabilities.  The paper uses VQGAN as the image generation system.\n*   **Importance of Image-Label Structure:** The paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining the underlying image-label structure during perturbation.  The perturbation should not fundamentally alter the object depicted in the image. The use of foundation models is crucial for enforcing this constraint.\n*   **Limitations of Existing Robustness Techniques:** The paper finds that some common corruption-robust models (e.g., those trained with Stylized-ImageNet, Adversarial Noise Training) fail to maintain their power under the dynamic evaluation protocol.  This suggests that these techniques might be overfitting to specific types of corruptions or perturbations, rather than achieving true robustness.\n*   **Perturbation in Meaningful Symbolic Space:** The paper highlights the Discrete Adversarial Training (DAT) method, which perturbs in \"meaningful symbolic space\" rather than continuous pixel space, and achieves better FMR. This reflects a trend towards adversarial attacks that operate on higher-level features and representations.\n*   **The Role of Data Augmentation:** The paper suggests that the superior performance of transformer variants (ViT, Swin) over ResNet in terms of FMR might be due to the use of strong data augmentation strategies during training. Augmentation introduces OOD samples, potentially improving robustness to data shifts. ConvNeXt, when equipped with similar data augmentation, achieves comparable performance. This reinforces the importance of diverse training data in achieving robustness.\n*   **Self-Attention and Robustness:** The paper explores the connection between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and robustness.  It finds that increasing the number of attention heads can enhance expressivity and robustness, albeit potentially at the expense of clean accuracy.\n*   **Transferability of Adversarial Examples:** The paper examines the transferability of generated adversarial examples. The results suggest a reasonable transferability, implying that the generated images are not entirely model-specific. This highlights the potential for using these generated images as a static benchmark for evaluating robustness.\n*   **Adversarial Training as Augmentation:** The paper explores using images generated by their system for adversarial training to improve robustness.\n*    **Sparse VQGAN for Efficient Perturbation:** In resource-constrained scenarios, the paper enhances efficiency by sparsifying VQGAN, discovering that only a small percentage of dimensions significantly impact style.\n*   **Zero-Shot Adversarial Robustness Concerns:** The paper recognizes that foundation models like CLIP are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. It includes an analysis of CLIP's zero-shot adversarial robustness and discusses techniques for mitigating this issue (gradient masking, using ensembles of foundation models).\n*   **Societal Bias of Large Models:** A discussion about the societal bias of relying on large models is included.\n*   **Masked Images:** The paper finds similar evidence in (Xiao et al., 2023), where the authors utilize masked images as counterfactual samples for robust fine-tuning.\n\n**III. Specific Techniques and Models Mentioned (Relevant to Identifying Trends):**\n\n*   **Models Evaluated:** The paper evaluates a wide range of models, including LeNet, ResNet, ViT, DeiT, Twins, Visformer, Swin, and ConvNeXt. It also considers robust ResNet50 variants trained with SIN, ANT, AugMix, DeepAugment, and DAT.\n*   **VQGAN:** Used as the image generation system for creating adversarial examples.\n*   **CLIP, ConvNeXt-T-CvSt, CoCa:** Used as the zoo of foundation models (surrogate oracles).\n*   **FGSM:** Used as an adversarial attack method (though the paper finds that initiating with FGSM examples has little effect on their overall approach).\n\n**IV. Key Takeaways (Summarizing the Trends):**\n\n*   **Moving towards Dynamic, Adaptive Evaluation:**  The field is shifting away from static datasets and towards methods that generate adversarial examples tailored to the model being evaluated.\n*   **Emphasis on Human-Aligned/Oracle-Aligned Robustness:** Robustness is increasingly defined by agreement with human perception or the performance of high-quality foundation models.\n*   **Generative Models for Adversarial Example Creation:** Generative models (like VQGAN) are becoming important tools for creating diverse and challenging adversarial examples.\n*   **Importance of Training Data Diversity and Augmentation:**  Diverse training data and strong data augmentation techniques play a crucial role in achieving robustness.\n*   **Exploration of Architectural Properties for Robustness:** Research is exploring how specific architectural choices (e.g., self-attention, number of attention heads) influence robustness.\n*   **Addressing Vulnerabilities of Foundation Models:** Recognizing the potential vulnerabilities of foundation models to adversarial attacks, researchers are developing techniques to mitigate these risks.\n\nIn summary, this paper contributes to the trend of developing more dynamic, adaptive, and human-aligned approaches to evaluating and improving adversarial robustness in image classification. It also provides a valuable critique of existing robustness techniques and highlights the importance of considering the limitations of foundation models."

      "summary": "Okay, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information from the provided paper, addressing the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Overall Focus of the Paper:**\n\nThe paper \"UNICAD: A Unified Approach for Attack Detection, Noise Reduction and Novel Class Identification\" focuses on developing a novel framework (UNICAD) to improve the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) for image classification, while also addressing the challenge of identifying novel, unseen classes. It emphasizes a unified approach that combines attack detection, noise reduction, and open set classification capabilities, rather than addressing each problem in isolation.\n\n**Relevance to Adversarial Robustness Trends (within the last 2 years):**\n\nThe paper directly addresses trends in adversarial robustness by proposing a system that can:\n\n1.  **Detect Adversarial Attacks:** UNICAD incorporates a similarity-based attack detection mechanism, leveraging DNNs' feature extraction capabilities to compare incoming data against known prototypes. This is based on a variation of the Sim-DNN approach[20].\n2.  **Reduce Adversarial Noise:** It uses a novel denoising autoencoder (DAE) schema to restore data altered by adversarial interference while retaining its essential characteristics.\n3.  **Maintain Classification Accuracy:** The system aims to recover from adversarial attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy.\n4. **Addresses limitations of current approaches:** Current methods are usually scenario specific, and robust systems often reduce classification accuracy. The proposed UNICAD aims to solve these limitations by providing a unified solution to adversarial robustness, standard classification, and handling unanticipated scenarios.\n\n**Key components of UNICAD for Adversarial Robustness**\n\n*   **Attack Detection Layer:** Based on [20], it detects attacks by comparing input data to known prototypes.  A significant drop in similarity triggers further processing.\n*   **Denoising Layer (DAE):** A novel autoencoder selectively removes adversarial noise, designed to handle both known and novel attack types effectively. The DAE is trained with a combined loss function (MSE, SSIM, and Feature-based Loss) for enhanced reconstruction and preservation of image features.\n*   **Attack Decision Layer:**  This layer makes the final decision. Reconstructed images are re-evaluated. If, after denoising, the image now aligns with a known class, the original input is flagged as an attack, and the image is classified correctly. If the similarity drop persists, it's classified as a new class.\n\n**Details on the Denoising Autoencoder (DAE):**\n\n*   **Training Data:** The DAE is trained on original clean images and images attacked using FGSM with \u03f5 = 0.3 and \u03f5 = 0.03 to improve trasnferability across different untrained types of attacks.\n*   **Loss Function:** The DAE uses a combined loss function:\n    *   Lcomb(x, x') = \u03c9MSE \u00b7 LMSE(x, x') + \u03c9SSIM \u00b7 LSSIM(x, x') + \u03c9Feature \u00b7 LFeat(\u03c8(x), \u03c8(x'))\n\n        Where\n        * MSE measures pixel-wise differences.\n        * SSIM preserves structural similarity.\n        * Feature Loss aligns features in latent space.\n*   **Architecture:** Uses an encoder-decoder structure with convolutions, batch normalization, pooling layers, and residual blocks.\n\n**Experimental Results and Performance:**\n\n*   The paper presents experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n*   UNICAD's performance is compared against other methods, including:\n    *   XClass [21]\n    *   SimDNN [20]\n    *   DDSA [19]\n*   UNICAD demonstrates effectiveness in adversarial mitigation and unseen class classification.\n*   The denoising autoencoder outperforms current state-of-the-art DAEs, with DINOv2 performing best as the backbone for Feature-based loss.\n*   Robustness against no defence is consistently over 80% results in the defence approach compared to the performance of classifiers where no defence is implemented.\n*   UNICAD excels with consistant > 70% accuracy in the presence of adversarial attacks, outperforming mainstream methods and affirming its theoretical robustness against such attacks and effectiveness in detecting new classes.\n\n**Backbone Networks:**\n\n*   The framework is tested with VGG-16 [22] and DINOv2 [23] as backbone networks for feature extraction.  DINOv2 generally shows superior performance due to its advanced feature extraction capabilities.\n\n**Significance and Contributions:**\n\n*   **Unified Framework:** UNICAD integrates attack detection, noise reduction, and novel class identification into a single framework.\n*   **Novel Denoising Layer:**  The proposed denoising autoencoder is a key contribution.\n*   **Prototype-Based Architecture:** Contributes to interpretability and adaptability.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n\n*   The paper acknowledges the need for further research on the scalability and efficiency of UNICAD.\n*   Future work will focus on optimizing the denoising layer to provide better adaptability and experimentation across a wider settings of datasets to further showcase UNICAD\u2019s performance along with robust ablation studies.\n\n**Relevant References (within the last 2 years, based on the publication year of this paper - most likely 2023 or 2024):**\n\n*   \\[3] X.

This indicates a growing interest in securing transformer-based models which are becoming increasingly popular in computer vision.\n2.  **Adaptive Attacks as a Primary Concern:** A key focus is on defending against *adaptive* attacks, which are designed to circumvent specific defense mechanisms.  The paper emphasizes that many existing defenses are not effective against these attacks. This suggests a shift from general adversarial robustness to more targeted and challenging scenarios.\n3.  **Balancing Accuracy and Robustness:** The inherent trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness continues to be a central issue.  The paper explicitly aims to mitigate the \"standard accuracy degradation\" often associated with adversarial training (AT).\n4.  **Detection-Based Mechanisms:**  The exploration of detection mechanisms to identify and reject adversarial examples is a recognized trend. However, the paper also points out the limitations of existing detection techniques, especially against adaptive attacks and in scenarios where rejection is not feasible. The paper contributes to this trend by proposing a novel detector.\n5.  **Adversarial Training (AT) Enhancements:**  Adversarial training remains a core technique, but the trend is towards more sophisticated AT methods. This paper leverages a customized adversarial training approach (One-step Least-Likely Adversarial Training) and combines it with architectural innovations.\n6.  **Self-Supervised Learning Integration:** The paper draws inspiration from self-supervised learning techniques like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for pre-training the classifier.  This suggests a trend towards leveraging self-supervision to learn more robust and generalizable visual representations.\n7.  **Ensemble Methods:** The \"adaptive ensemble\" component of the proposed architecture points to a broader trend of using ensemble methods to improve robustness.  The paper dynamically combines the outputs of different encoders based on the detector's confidence.\n8.  **Masking Strategies:**  Randomly masking image patches is employed to mitigate the effects of adversarial perturbations. This aligns with a growing trend of using masking techniques as a defense mechanism.\n\n**Specific Techniques and Components**\n\n*   **Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA) with Guided Backpropagation:**  A novel use of MSA combined with Guided Backpropagation to enhance the detection of adversarial perturbations. Guided Backpropagation highlights the areas of the image most influential in the classification decision, making subtle adversarial changes more visible.\n*   **Soft-Nearest Neighbors (SNN) Loss:**  Used to maximize the difference between clean images and adversarial examples in the feature space, aiding in detection.\n*   **Two Encoders (Clean and Adversarial):**  A dedicated encoder for clean images and another for adversarial examples. This allows the model to learn distinct representations and reduces the impact of adversarial training on standard accuracy.\n*   **Adaptive Ensemble:** Dynamically combines the outputs of the clean and adversarial encoders based on the detector's confidence.\n*   **One-step Least-Likely Adversarial Training:** Generates adversarial examples by targeting the least likely class, potentially creating more challenging adversarial samples.\n*   **Contrastive Loss (SimCLR):**  Used during pre-training to encourage similarity between visual representations of clean and adversarial variants of the same image.\n\n**Experimental Results and Evaluation**\n\n*   The paper showcases strong experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.\n*   The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial training methods in both standard accuracy and adversarial robustness.\n*   Robustness is evaluated against three adaptive attacks: AutoAttack, Adaptive Auto Attack (A[3]), and Parameter-Free Adaptive Auto Attack (PF-A[3]).\n*   Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of key components like the contrastive loss, adaptive ensemble, MSA, Guided Backpropagation, and SNN loss.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nThe paper demonstrates a multifaceted approach to adversarial robustness in ViTs, reflecting several key trends in the field over the last two years. These include a strong focus on adaptive attacks, balancing accuracy and robustness, leveraging self-supervised learning principles, integrating detection mechanisms, and employing ensemble and masking strategies.

      "summary": "Okay, let's break down this research paper and extract the information relevant to the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\n**Focusing on the core contributions and related works, here's what's relevant from this paper:**\n\n**1. Key Trend: Dynamic and Adaptive Adversarial Training:**\n\n*   The central theme of this paper, **Dynamic Perturbation-Adaptive Adversarial Training (DPAAT)**, represents a significant trend. The core idea is to move *beyond* fixed perturbation sizes in adversarial training and instead adapt the perturbation based on the characteristics of the data and the current state of the training process.\n*   **Problem Addressed:** Conventional Adversarial Training (AT) and Standard Adversarial Training (SAT) suffer from fixed perturbation sizes, leading to generalization decline and limiting robustness improvement.\n*   **DPAAT Approach:**\n    *   **Dynamic Learning Environment:** DPAAT places AT in a dynamic learning environment to generate more suitable adaptive perturbation sizes.\n    *   **Loss-Based Adaptation:** DPAAT adapts the perturbation size by collecting loss information as reference knowledge of the training. It classifies data as \"relatively fragile\" or \"relatively stable\" based on how much the loss changes after adding adversarial perturbations.\n    *   **Relatively Fragile Data:** Perturbation sizes are *decreased* to avoid crossing classifier boundaries.\n    *   **Relatively Stable Data:** Perturbation sizes are *increased* to further improve robustness.\n    *   **Synchronization Loss:** A new loss function to optimize synchronization between robustness and generalization to achieve better performance on both.\n\n**2. Related Works & Contextualization (Recent Methods Compared):**\n\n*   The paper positions DPAAT in relation to other adversarial training techniques, including:\n    *   **Standard Adversarial Training (SAT):** This involves training with both raw data and adversarial examples.\n    *   **Adaptive-Margin Adversarial Training (AMAT) [17]:**  This method uses a loss-defined margin strategy to craft adaptive adversarial examples with various perturbation sizes.\n    *   **Instance Adaptive Adversarial Training [18]:** Improve accuracy tradeoffs in neural nets.\n    *   **Adaptive Perturbation Adversarial Training [19]:** Based on reinforcement learning.\n*   **Limitations of Existing Methods:**\n    *   SAT and AT suffer from heavy computational overhead and generalization decline.\n    *   AMAT relies on external transference and cannot be updated during training.\n\n**3. Experiments and Results (Indicating Efficacy of DPAAT):**\n\n*   **Dataset:** HAM10000 dermatology dataset (medical image classification).\n*   **Baselines Compared:** AT, SAT, AMAT\n*   **Adversarial Attacks Used:** FGSM, IFGSM, PGD\n*   **CNN Architectures:**  ResNet34, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, ShufflenetV2, and SqueezeNet\n*   **Key Metrics:**\n    *   Robustness Accuracy (RAcc)\n    *   Generalization Accuracy (GAcc)\n    *   Mean Average Precision (mAP)\n    *   Mean Average Robustness Precision (mARP)\n    *   Precision\n    *   Recall\n    *   F1-score\n    *   Grad-CAM (for interpretability)\n\n*   **Key Findings:**\n    *   DPAAT achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to AT, SAT, and AMAT.\n    *   DPAAT improves interpretability of CNNs (better Grad-CAM visualizations).\n    *   Dynamic perturbation adaption alleviated the generalization decline.\n    *   Synchronization optimality needed the dynamic perturbation adaptation as a premise to fully give its advantages.\n\n**4. Additional Trends Highlighted (Indirectly):**\n\n*   **Focus on Generalization:** A recurring theme is that improving robustness *should not* come at the expense of generalization performance.  The paper explicitly aims to preserve high generalization while improving robustness.\n*   **Emphasis on Interpretability:**  The paper also highlights the importance of interpretability, especially in medical image classification.\n\n**5.

      "summary": "Okay, let's extract the relevant information from this paper to address the research question: \"What are the latest trends in adversarial robustness for image classification? Only consider papers from the last 2 years.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the information, focusing on trends, the novelty of the presented approach (MAD), and comparisons to other recent methods.\n\n**Core Idea of the Paper (MAD - Mask-based Adversarial Defense):**\n\n*   The paper introduces a new adversarial defense scheme called \"Mask-based Adversarial Defense\" (MAD).\n*   **Key Idea:** Randomly mask portions of input images during both training and testing to make DNNs more tolerant to minor input perturbations (adversarial attacks).\n*   The paper posits that natural images have spatial redundancy, and adversarial perturbations are often small.  Masking can reduce the impact of these perturbations.\n*   **How it works:**\n    *   Images are divided into grids (e.g., 4x4 or 8x8).\n    *   Each grid is randomly masked with a certain probability (mask rate).\n    *   During testing, the image is masked multiple times with different random masks, and the final classification is based on the most frequent output class (voting).\n\n**Novelty and Advantages of MAD:**\n\n*   **Simplicity and Applicability:** The method is easily applicable to many existing DNNs without requiring changes to the DNN structure, loss functions, or input filtering (unlike autoencoder-based approaches).\n*   **Resistance to Adaptive White-Box Attacks:** The randomized masking at both training and testing aims to improve resistance against adaptive white-box attacks (where the attacker knows the defense mechanism). The technique may enforce attackers to consider an attack space of size exponential to the number of grids required to cover the input.\n*   **Performance Improvement:** Experiments showed significant improvements in defense against adversarial samples (up to 93% precision gain in some cases).\n\n**Comparison with Other Adversarial Defense Techniques (Highlighting Trends and the Positioning of MAD):**\n\nThe paper classifies existing adversarial defense approaches into two main categories:\n\n1.  **Additional Denoising Structures:** (Before the DNN)\n    *   Examples: MagNet [Meng and Chen, 2017], HGD [Liao et al., 2018], Defense-GAN [Samangouei et al., 2018], Denoised Smoothing [Salman et al., 2020], PixelDefend [Song et al., 2018].\n    *   **Critique:** These methods add complexity (more network parameters) to remove adversarial noise.\n    *   **MAD's Advantage:** MAD outperforms MagNet and Denoised Smoothing in many test cases without needing extra network structures.\n2.  **DNN Model Enhancement:** (Making the DNN itself more robust)\n    *   Examples: Adversarial Training [Madry et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020], Defensive Distillation [Papernot et al., 2016a].\n    *   **Critique:** Adversarial training and defensive distillation can be computationally expensive. Modifying DNN structures might introduce human bias and degrade performance.\n    *   **MAD's Advantage:** MAD doesn't require changes to the network structure or loss function design.\n\n**Specific methods mentioned in the paper as being state-of-the-art:**\n\n*   MagNet [Meng and Chen, 2017]\n*   Denoised smoothing [Salman et al., 2020]\n*   Parseval networks [Cisse et al., 2017]\n*   PCL [Mustafa et al., 2019]\n\n**Experimental Results and Settings:**\n\n*   **Models and Datasets:** LeNet (MNIST), VGG16 (CIFAR-10), ResNet18 (SVHN).\n*   **Adversarial Attacks Used:**\n    *   FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) [Goodfellow et al., 2015]\n    *   BIM (Basic Iterative Method) [Kurakin et al., 2017]\n    *   PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) [Madry et al., 2018]\n    *   DeepFool [Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016]\n    *   CW (Carlini & Wagner) [Carlini and Wagner, 2017]\n*   **Key Hyperparameters for MAD:**\n    *   **Mask Rate:** Probability of masking a grid. Higher mask rates lead to better defense but potentially lower accuracy on clean images. Experiments suggest that a mask rate of 3/4 could be a reasonable trade-off.\n    *   **Grid Size:** The size of the grids used for masking. The paper indicates that smaller grid size may produce a better defense.\n*   **Comparison:** The paper compared MAD with four state-of-the-art adversarial defence methods (MagNet, Denoised smoothing, Parseval networks, and PCL). MAD outperforms in most cases.\n\n**Important Caveats and Considerations:**\n\n*   The optimal mask rate and grid size may vary depending on the DNN model and dataset.\n*   The paper focuses on image classification.\n\n**Key Takeaways for Answering the Research Question:**\n\n*   **Trend of Masking/Randomization:** MAD contributes to a trend of using randomization (specifically, masking) as a defense mechanism. This aligns with other works that introduce randomized variations to inputs or network parameters during training.\n*   **Trend of Simplicity:** MAD emphasizes simplicity and ease of integration with existing architectures, contrasting with methods that require complex architectural modifications or additional denoising networks.\n*   **Focus on White-Box Attack Resistance:** A key focus is to withstand adaptive white-box attacks, suggesting a growing concern about attackers adapting to specific defense mechanisms.\n*   **Balancing Robustness and Accuracy:**  The paper acknowledges the trade-off between robustness and accuracy on clean inputs.\n*   **Performance Against Strong Attacks:** MAD demonstrates strong performance against a range of attacks, including CW, which is known to be effective against many defenses.\n*   **Comparison to Established Defenses:** The results suggest that MAD is competitive with, and in some cases outperforms, several recent and established adversarial defense techniques.\n*   **Importance of Hyperparameter Tuning:** Emphasizes the need to tune hyperparameters like mask rate and grid size for different models and datasets.\n\n**Papers Published in the Last 2 Years (relevant to the research question):**\n\n*   Cohen et al., 2020. Detecting adversarial samples using influence functions and nearest neighbors.\n*   Lee et al., 2020. Adversarial vertex mixup: Toward better adversarially robust generalization.\n*   Salman et al., 2020. Denoised smoothing: A provable defense for pretrained classifiers.\n*   He et al., 2021. Masked autoencoders are scalable vision learners.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend highlighted in this paper is the use of masking/randomization as a defense mechanism. MAD contributes to this trend by introducing a simple and effective method that can be easily integrated with existing architectures, emphasizing resistance to white-box attacks and balancing robustness with accuracy."

      "relevancy": "Published in September 2021, this paper presents a post-training robustness strategy using test time augmentations and a random forest classifier. While slightly outside the 2-year window, it introduces Augmented Random Forest (ARF), a simple and easy-to-use strategy for robustifying an existing pretrained DNN without modifying its weights. It achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness.",
      "summary": "Based on the provided paper, here's a detailed extraction of the most relevant information regarding recent trends in adversarial robustness for image classification, focusing on papers from the last 2 years:\n\n**Core Focus of the Paper:**\n\n*   **Simple Post-Training Robustness:** The paper introduces \"Augmented Random Forest\" (ARF), a method to improve the adversarial robustness of pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) *without* retraining the DNN itself. This is a key trend: defenses that can be applied to existing models are valuable.\n\n**Key Components and How They Relate to Robustness Trends:**\n\n1.  **Test Time Augmentations (TTAs):**\n\n    *   **Method:** ARF leverages randomized test-time augmentations (TTAs) like color jitter, blur, noise, and geometric transformations *at inference time*.  This aligns with the trend of using augmentations for robustness.\n    *   **Relevance:** TTAs are not new *per se*.  The paper acknowledges that TTAs alone were shown to be circumvented by adaptive attacks.  However, ARF strategically *re-purposes* TTAs not as a standalone defense, but as input to a random forest classifier. This leverages the potential of TTAs to obfuscate gradients but addresses the known weaknesses through the random forest.\n    *   **Connection to the Literature:** The paper cites several works that utilize transformations on the input image, but acknowledges Athalye et al. ([2, 3]), which found TTA based approaches susceptible to white-box attacks like EoT.\n\n2.  **Random Forest Classifier:**\n\n    *   **Method:**  A random forest is trained *on the logits* (outputs before softmax) of a pre-trained DNN when fed augmented images (TTAs).\n    *   **Relevance:** The random forest learns to predict the \"true\" class label from the distribution of logits generated by the TTAs. This means the random forest learns to correct the DNN's prediction when it is misled by adversarial examples.\n    *   **Novelty:**  Attaching a random forest to DNN outputs isn't entirely novel.  The paper directly compares itself to [20], which also uses a random forest.  ARF claims improvements by:\n        *   Avoiding manual analysis of DNN layers.\n        *   Being applicable to any classifier that produces logits.\n        *   Showing robustness on more complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet.\n        *   Demonstrating robustness to adaptive white-box attacks (which [20]'s approach allegedly lacks).\n\n3.  **Combination with Adversarial Training:**\n\n    *   **Key Finding:** ARF achieves \"state-of-the-art defense\" *when combined with an adversarially trained network* (specifically, networks trained with VAT or TRADES).\n    *   **Relevance:**  This highlights a key trend:  defenses are often most effective when layered or combined. ARF does *not* replace adversarial training, but it can significantly *enhance* it.\n\n**Attack Strategies & Threat Models (Also Indicative of Trends):**\n\n*   The paper emphasizes evaluation against a diverse set of attacks and threat models, including:\n\n    *   **Black-box attacks:** (Boundary, Square) - The adversary can only query the network.\n    *   **Gray-box attacks:** (FGSM, JSMA, PGD, Deepfool, CW) - The adversary has access to the DNN's parameters.\n    *   **Adaptive Black-box Attack**: adversary can query the final output of the random forest\n    *   **Adaptive Gray-box Attacks:** These are a *crucial* trend.\n        *   **A-FGSM, A-PGD:** Modified versions of FGSM and PGD that take into account the test-time augmentations.\n    *   **Adaptive White-box Attack**: The paper recognizes the importance of adaptive attacks. ARF includes a substitute model to estimate gradients of the random forest, concatenated with DNN parameters.\n\n**Limitations and Insights:**\n\n*   **White-box Vulnerability:**  ARF, *on its own*, is vulnerable to a strong white-box attack (BPDA \u2013 Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation). *This is a critical point*. The paper *admits* this vulnerability but argues that:\n    *   Combining ARF with adversarial training (TRADES) makes it more robust.\n    *   The BPDA attack generates *perceptible noise*, reducing its efficacy in real-world scenarios.\n\n**Cited Papers (Indicative of the Landscape):**\n\n*   The paper references numerous other publications in adversarial robustness, including:\n\n    *   **Attacks:** FGSM ([23]), JSMA ([49]), DeepFool ([44]), CW ([9, 8]), Boundary Attack ([5]), Square Attack ([1]), PGD ([41]).  These are foundational attacks against which robustness is often measured.\n    *   **Defenses:** Adversarial training ([23, 41]), regularization techniques ([52, 29, 54, 27, 32, 15, 71, 73]), gradient masking ([6, 19, 25, 55]), adding noise ([17, 30, 67]), knowledge distillation ([47]), virtual adversarial training (VAT) ([43]), TRADES ([72]), test-time augmentation ([22, 24, 38, 39, 64, 66]) and feature squeezing ([68]).\n\n**In summary, the paper indicates the following recent trends:**\n\n1.  **Post-Training Robustness:**  Methods that can improve the robustness of existing models without retraining are desirable.\n2.  **Adaptive Attacks:** Evaluation against adaptive attacks is *essential*. Defenses must be tested against adversaries that are aware of the defense mechanism.\n3.  **Combining Defenses:** Layering or combining different defense strategies is often more effective than relying on a single technique. Adversarial training remains a strong foundation.\n4.  **Importance of Threat Model:** The effectiveness of a defense depends heavily on the threat model (black-box, gray-box, white-box). Defenses effective in one threat model may be easily broken in another.\n5.  **Balancing Robustness and Accuracy:** Many defenses reduce accuracy on clean (non-adversarial) examples. A good defense should maintain high clean accuracy while improving robustness.\n6.  **Test time Augmentation:** Using image augmentations during test time can lead to robustness."
