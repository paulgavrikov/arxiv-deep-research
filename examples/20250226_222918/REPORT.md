## Scientific Report: Optimal Kernel Size for Convolutional Neural Networks

### Introduction

This report investigates the question of what constitutes the best kernel size for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Given the wide range of applications and architectures, this report aims to synthesize findings from a selection of recent research papers to offer a nuanced perspective on kernel size selection. The report considers not only the direct impact of kernel size on accuracy but also its interplay with factors such as computational cost, hardware efficiency, model robustness, and the specific task at hand.

### Background

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various machine learning tasks, particularly in image processing and computer vision. The convolutional layer, a fundamental building block of CNNs, utilizes kernels to extract features from input data. The size of these kernels, often referred to as the filter size, is a crucial hyperparameter that determines the receptive field of the neurons and influences the network's ability to capture patterns and dependencies in the data.

Historically, smaller kernels such as 3x3 have been preferred due to their computational efficiency and ability to capture local features. However, recent research has challenged this paradigm, exploring the benefits of larger kernels, adaptive kernel sizes, and alternative kernel shapes to enhance model performance and address specific limitations. This report seeks to synthesize these recent developments and provide a comprehensive overview of the considerations involved in kernel size selection for CNNs.

### Literature Review and Analysis

#### 1. Adaptive Kernel Sizes and Dynamic Convolution

Several papers emphasize the benefits of adaptive kernel sizes, where the network learns to adjust the kernel size based on the input data. Tek, Çam, and Karlı [2] proposed an adaptive kernel learning approach using a differentiable Gaussian envelope, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over fixed-size kernels. They found that larger adaptive kernels (7x7, 9x9) often perform best, as the adaptivity allows them to adjust their receptive field to the most relevant features.

Chen et al. [6] introduced Dynamic Convolution, where multiple convolution kernels are aggregated dynamically based on input-dependent attentions. While this approach favors smaller kernels for individual components due to computational efficiency, it offers a mechanism to combine them effectively for increased representational power. This suggests that smaller kernels with dynamic combination can rival the performance of static large kernels.

Romero et al. [4] proposed FlexConv, which learns kernel sizes during training and explores continuous kernel convolutions. They argue that different layers benefit from different kernel sizes and that fixing kernel sizes *a priori* is suboptimal. Their results suggest that kernels should generally increase in size as you go deeper into the network. Similarly, Romero and Zeghidour [18] introduced DNArch, a method for jointly learning the weights and the architecture of CNNs by backpropagation, allowing for learning the size of convolutional kernels at each layer. They found that large kernels are often beneficial in 1D tasks, while diverse, rectangular kernels are often effective in 2D tasks.

Li et al. [3] proposed Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), which dynamically adjusts convolutional kernels along various dimensions, including spatial size. While not directly optimizing kernel size, this approach emphasizes that *how* you use a kernel is just as important as the size itself, with the spatial attention mechanism potentially compensating for a non-optimal kernel size.

These approaches highlight that there isn't a single "best" kernel size for all CNNs and tasks. The optimal size can depend on the network architecture, the dataset, and the specific layer within the network.

#### 2. Large Kernel Convolutions

Several recent studies advocate for the use of large kernel convolutions, challenging the conventional wisdom of stacking small kernels. Luo et al. [5] strongly advocate for large kernel convolutions (specifically a decomposed 21x21 kernel) for single image dehazing, arguing that they increase the receptive field and capture more structured information. However, they address the computational challenges by decomposing the large kernel into a combination of smaller and dilated convolutions.

Xu et al. [11] proposed ParCNetV2, which leverages "oversized convolutions" (kernels with a size approximately twice the input feature size) to model long-range dependencies and achieve implicit positional encoding. Their experiments demonstrate improved performance on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks.

Li et al. [7] challenges the notion of *simply* increasing kernel size, proposing a shift-wise operator that achieves the effects of large kernel sizes using smaller convolutions combined with a shifting mechanism. This operator aims to capture long-range dependencies sparsely, mimicking the sparse attention mechanism in Transformers.

Liu et al. [17] investigated scaling kernel sizes beyond 51x51 using sparsity. Their proposed SLaK (Sparse Large Kernel Network) architecture, based on sparse factorized 51x51 kernels, achieves performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art hierarchical Transformers and modern ConvNets.

These studies suggest that large kernels can be effective for capturing long-range dependencies and improving performance, but they often require careful design and optimization to address the associated computational challenges.

#### 3. Trade-offs and Efficient Implementations

The increased computational cost of larger kernels is a recurring theme in the literature. Ma et al. [1] and [9] introduced hyper-convolutions to decouple kernel size from the number of learnable parameters, enabling the use of larger kernels with improved parameter efficiency. They found that larger kernels are generally better for tasks requiring a larger receptive field but that simply increasing kernel size in standard convolutions leads to overfitting.

Chen et al. [12] proposed XSepConv, which fuses spatially separable convolutions into depthwise convolution to reduce computational cost and parameter size of large kernels. Their experiments demonstrate that replacing 5x5 depthwise convolutions in MobileNetV3-Small with XSepConv leads to improved accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Chen et al. [14] also found that by simply replacing 3x3 filters with 5x5 filters in depthwise convolutions in MobileNetV1-0.25, the accuracy on ImageNet increased by more than 1%. This demonstrates that larger kernels in depthwise convolutions can improve accuracy for image classification. They also introduced a "DDC layer" which combines depthwise convolutions with dilated convolutions, reducing computational costs.

Hoang and Jo [15] introduced PydMobileNet, which uses a pyramid of kernel sizes within the Depthwise Separable Convolution operation. Their experiments show that using a combination of kernel sizes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7) generally leads to better performance than using a single 3x3 kernel size.

Chen et al. [10] used dynamic multi-scale convolution to incorporate multiple kernel sizes (3x3 and 5x5) in parallel paths to capture features at different scales. They also explored depth-wise separable convolutions with kernel sizes of 5x5 and 7x7 as a lightweight alternative to standard convolutions.

These studies suggest that a multi-scale approach, where a combination of different kernel sizes are used to capture features at different scales, can be an effective strategy. They also highlight the importance of using efficient implementations, such as depthwise separable convolutions and dynamic convolution, to mitigate the computational cost of larger kernels.

#### 4. Hardware Considerations

Several papers emphasized the importance of considering the target hardware when selecting kernel sizes. Chen et al. [14] designed a hardware architecture that efficiently handles depthwise convolutions with kernels larger than 3x3. Li et al. [2024.12736v1] argued against *simply* increasing kernel size due to hardware limitations. Chen et al. [2020.02.12046v1] addressed the challenges of using even-sized kernels due to the "shift problem" and emphasized the importance of symmetric padding to improve generalization abilities. They also proposed an improved symmetric padding strategy, performing symmetric padding within four successive even-sized convolution layers instead of a single even-sized convolution layer.

Chen et al. [111] focused on tailoring the hyperparameters of a wide-kernel CNN to fit different bearing fault vibration datasets, demonstrating that dataset properties, such as sampling rate, impact the optimal values of hyperparameters.

Chen et al. [2019.12.12405v2] introduced a genetic algorithm-based technique to reduce the efforts of finding the optimal combination of a hyper-parameter (kernel size) of a convolutional neural network-based architecture, directly addressing the research question.

Chen et al. [24] and Jiang et al. [2410.03435v1] proposed FPGA-based accelerators for CNNs. These papers considered the trade-offs and proposed a hardware design that supports various kernel sizes efficiently. They found that their design has shorter computational time for depthwise convolutions with either 3x3 or 5x5 kernels. The architecture is designed such that increasing kernel size does not significantly decrease computational efficiency.

Chen et al. [2020.02.2711:46:17Z] further emphasized that the choice of hyperparameters for a neural network can be different depending on the target machine.

These papers highlight that the optimal kernel size is not only determined by the network's accuracy but also by the characteristics of the target hardware.  A kernel size that is theoretically optimal might not be practical due to hardware limitations.

#### 5. Specific Applications

Some papers focused on specific applications, providing insights into the optimal kernel size within that particular context.

Yang et al. [2024.10.03 01:19:21Z] explored kernel sizes for pancreas segmentation in CT images. They found that a combination of different kernel sizes (e.g., 3x3 and 5x5) can be beneficial for capturing features at multiple scales and that depth-wise separable convolutions can be an effective way to reduce the computational cost of larger kernels.

Luo et al. [2022.09.05 06:56:48Z] strongly advocated for large kernel convolutions (specifically a decomposed 21x21 kernel) for single image dehazing, provided that the computational challenges are addressed.

Shan et al. [2020.01.19 04:21:51Z] argued that a combination of different kernel sizes is better than using a single, fixed kernel size for video action recognition. The best-performing configuration tested in the ablation study used kernel sizes of 1, 3, 5, and 7.

Ahmad et al. [2022.01.04 06:30:24Z] suggested that using a combination of different kernel sizes in a CNN architecture, specifically within a hybrid 2D/3D Inception network framework enhanced with an attention mechanism, can significantly improve hyperspectral image classification accuracy.

Chen et al. [2021.04.06 05:52:25Z] used 3x3 kernels in deformable convolution layers and 2x2 kernels for max-pooling in a network for change detection in SAR images.

Chen et al. [2024.11.19 09:17:13Z] tailored hyperparameters, including kernel width, of a wide-kernel CNN to fit different bearing fault vibration datasets.

These studies highlight the importance of considering the specific characteristics of the task and dataset when selecting kernel sizes.  The optimal kernel size for one application may not be optimal for another.

#### 6. Alternatives to Large Kernels

Several papers explored alternative approaches to achieve the benefits of large receptive fields without directly using large kernels.

Li et al. [2024.01.23 13:13:45Z] proposed a "shift-wise operator" that achieves the effects of large kernel sizes using smaller, more hardware-friendly convolutions combined with a shifting mechanism.

Romero et al. [2021.10.15 12:35:49Z] proposed FlexConv, which learns kernel sizes during training and explores continuous kernel convolutions. They found that varying kernel sizes allows the optimal size to be learned, and that the best architecture is somewhere in the middle of small and large kernel sizes.

Hoang and Jo [2018.11.17 02:58:31Z] proposed PydMobileNet, which uses a pyramid of kernel sizes within the Depthwise Separable Convolution operation.

Chen et al. [2020.02.27 11:46:17Z] introduced XSepConv, which fuses spatially separable convolutions into depthwise convolution to reduce the computational cost and parameter size of large kernels.

These approaches suggest that the benefits of large receptive fields can be achieved without directly using large kernels, offering a more efficient and flexible way to design CNN architectures.

#### 7. Challenging the Assumption of Large Kernels

Some recent papers challenge the assumption that large kernels are the primary driver of high performance.

Yasuki and Taki [2024.03.11 12:48:22Z] argued that improvements in feature map quality are more critical than large effective receptive fields for downstream tasks like Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL). They found that modern CNNs, such as ConvNeXt and RepLKNet, generate improved feature maps that address inherent problems in traditional Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods used for WSOL.

Gavrikov and Keuper [2023.01.26 19:17:10Z] demonstrated that modern CNN architectures can achieve high test accuracies without updating randomly initialized spatial convolution filters. Instead, 1x1 convolutions provide the necessary recombination to create expressive network operators.

These papers suggest that other factors, such as feature map quality and the presence of linear combinations, can be just as important as kernel size in determining CNN performance.

#### 8. Dataset and Task Specific

Many studies highlighted the importance of tailoring kernel size selection to the specific dataset and task at hand.

Tomen and van Gemert [2021.10.15 12:35:49Z] found that the benefits of larger kernel sizes are more pronounced when spectral leakage is addressed using a Hamming window. They also found that a 7x7 kernel size combined with a Hamming window provides better robustness against adversarial attacks.

Yang et al. [2017.03.15 00:52:50Z] advocated for using multiple parallel hybrid sub-nets, each employing different kernel sizes, for hyperspectral image classification. They argued that convolutions with different spatial sizes can capture more discriminative and important information for pixel-based HSIC.

Kulwa et al. [2022.09.13 08:14:49Z] found that larger kernel sizes (specifically 7x7 in their study) are generally better for CNNs used in sEMG-based motion intent classification with raw sEMG signals.

Hudson et al. [2024.11.19 09:17:13Z] emphasized that the optimal kernel size in the first layer of a wide-kernel CNN is highly dependent on the dataset when applied to bearing fault detection.

Yang et al. [2024.10.03 01:19:21Z] found that 5x5 convolutional layers achieved the best segmentation for pancreas segmentation in CT images.

Li et al. [2020.01.19 04:21:51Z] argued that the best approach is to use a mixture of different sizes, implemented in a depthwise convolutional manner to improve both accuracy and efficiency for action recognition tasks.

These studies highlight that the characteristics of the dataset and the requirements of the task play a crucial role in determining the optimal kernel size.

### Conclusion

Based on the synthesis of information from the reviewed papers, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1.  **No Universally Optimal Kernel Size:** The research suggests that there is no single "best" kernel size for all CNNs and tasks. The optimal kernel size depends on a complex interplay of factors, including network architecture, dataset characteristics, computational constraints, and the desired trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

2.  **Context-Specific Optimization:** The best approach involves tailoring the kernel size selection to the specific context of the application. This includes considering the following factors:
    *   The type of data being processed (e.g., images, audio, time series).
    *   The complexity of the features being extracted (e.g., local details, long-range dependencies).
    *   The desired trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.
    *   The target hardware platform and its architectural characteristics.

3.  **Large Kernels Can Be Effective (With Caveats):** Recent research suggests that larger kernels can be beneficial for capturing long-range dependencies and improving performance, particularly on tasks requiring a large receptive field. However, simply increasing kernel size can lead to increased computational cost and overfitting. Therefore, careful design and optimization techniques are needed to effectively leverage large kernels.

4.  **Adaptive and Multi-Scale Approaches Are Promising:** Several studies advocate for adaptive kernel sizes, where the network learns to adjust the kernel size based on the input data. Multi-scale approaches, where a combination of different kernel sizes are used to capture features at multiple scales, are also shown to be effective.

5.  **Hardware Considerations Are Critical:** The choice of kernel size should consider the target hardware platform and its limitations. Efficient hardware implementations, such as those using depthwise separable convolutions, tensor decompositions, and specialized FPGA architectures, can help to mitigate the computational cost of larger kernels.

6.  **Smaller Kernels Can Be Sufficient (If Used Strategically):** Smaller kernels can achieve similar performance to larger kernels if they are combined with other techniques to increase the receptive field, such as dilated convolutions, shift-wise operators, or stacking multiple layers. In some cases, smaller kernels may even be preferred due to their reduced computational cost and potential for improved generalization.

7.  **The Future of Kernel Size Selection:** The trend towards automated neural architecture search (NAS) suggests that the future of kernel size selection will involve algorithms that can automatically discover the optimal kernel sizes (and other architectural parameters) for a given task and hardware platform.
